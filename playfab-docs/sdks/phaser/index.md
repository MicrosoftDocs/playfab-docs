# Phaser SDK (Javascript)

![Phaser SDK (Javascript)](./media/Phaser1.png)

Our JavaScript SDK is fully compatible with Phaser.io, and provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API.

This SDK is auto-generated using our open-sourced tool&mdash;[SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every other week to stay current with the latest API changes.

This SDK can alternatively be obtained via our CDN. Additional details can be found [here](https://playfab.com/playfab-now-serving-javascript-sdk-via-cdn/).
