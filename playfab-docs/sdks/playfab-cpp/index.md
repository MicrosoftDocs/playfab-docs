# Legacy PlayFab Services SDK for C++

![PlayFab CPP SDK](./media/cpp1.png)

> [!NOTE]  
> This SDK is being replaced by the new [PlayFab C/C++ SDK](../c/index.md). We are expanding the set of supported platforms for the new SDK over time.

The cross-platform C++ PlayFab SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. It includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

If you have questions about the SDK or need help with resolving issues, go to [PlayFab forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html) > **API and SDK**.

## SDK download links

- [Cross-platform C++ PlayFab SDK GitHub repo](https://github.com/PlayFab/XPlatCppSdk)
- [NuGet package for cross-platform C++ SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/com.playfab.xplatcppsdk.v141/)

This SDK is autogenerated using our open-sourced tool&mdash;[SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every other week to stay current with the latest API changes.

## Platforms supported by this SDK

- Android
- iOS
- Linux
- Windows (Win32) x64

## When not to use this SDK

The cross-platform C++ PlayFab SDK shouldn't be used if there's a more specific SDK that is suited for your project. Many C++ based engines also integrate Lua.

Specific PlayFab SDK is available for:
* [Cocos2d-x PlayFab SDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/Cocos2d-xSDK)
* [Unreal Engine PlayFab SDK at Unreal marketplace (external link)](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/product/playfab-sdk)
* [LuaSDK PlayFab SDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/LuaSdk)

For a full list of the different PlayFab SDKs, see [PlayFab Services SDKs](../playfab-sdk-intro.md).

## Development for Xbox and Windows GDK

This SDK is __not__ intended for use with modern Xbox and GamePass games and the [Microsoft Game Development Kit](/gaming/gdk/). To learn more about using the PlayFab Services SDK included in the GDK, see our [GDK overview](../c/index.md).

## Using the SDK

This native C++ project can be used in the following ways.

- As a stand-alone console Admin tools for maintaining your game.
  - The cross-platform C++ PlayFab SDK works great for a stand-alone C++ program.
- Integrated into an existing Visual Studio based C++ game.
  - Download the [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/com.playfab.xplatcppsdk.v141/) into your Visual Studio Solution, and you're ready to go.
- Integrated into an existing C++ based game engine.

## Add SDK to your project

- [Quickstart for Android](https://github.com/PlayFab/XPlatCppSdk/tree/master/build/Android)
- [Quickstart for iOS](https://github.com/PlayFab/XPlatCppSdk/blob/master/build/iOS/TestIOSApp/README.md)
- [Quickstart for Linux](quickstart-linux.md)
- [Quickstart for Windows (Win32) x64](quickstart-windows.md)

If none of the above options work for you, you can install the NuGet package into your Visual Studio project using the NuGet Package Manager. For instructions, see [Install and use a package in Visual Studio](/nuget/quickstart/install-and-use-a-package-in-visual-studio). For more information, see [Getting started with NuGet](/nuget/what-is-nuget).
