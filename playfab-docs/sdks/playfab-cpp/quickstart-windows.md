# C++ quickstart for Windows

This quickstart helps you make your first API call in C++.

Before you can call any PlayFab API, you must have a [PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). 

A native C++ project can be used a few ways:

- As stand-alone console Admin tools for maintaining your game.
  - The PlayFab Cross-Platform C++ SDK works great for a stand-alone C++ program.

- Integrated into an existing Visual Studio based C++ game.
  - Follow the instructions below to integrate the NuGet Package into your Visual Studio Solution, and you're ready to go.

- Integrated into an existing C++ based game engine.
  - The PlayFab Cross-Platform C++ SDK should not be used if we provide a more specific SDK.
    - [Cocos2d-x](https://github.com/PlayFab/Cocos2d-xSDK)
    - [Unreal](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnrealCppSdk)

  - Many C++ based engines also integrate Lua.

    - [LuaSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/LuaSdk)

  - Finally, if none of these options work for you, follow the instructions below to integrate the NuGet Package into your Visual Studio Solution. If you have any issues, let us know on the [Forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html).

## Windows C++ project setup

OS: This guide is written for Windows 10, using Visual Studio 2017.

Installation:

1. Download and install the [PlayFab Cross-Platform (CPP) SDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/XPlatCppSdk).

2. Download and install Visual Studio 2017.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The PlayFab Cross-Platform C++ SDK is no longer supported on Visual Studio 2013 and Visual Studio 2015.

3. Create a new C++ Console project.

4. Right-click on the project in **Solution Explorer**, select **Manage NuGet packages**, and search for "playfab." You should see a small number of matches, and you're looking for `com.playfab.xplatcppsdk.vXXX`. Install the `json cpp` packages. Your project should now compile.  

PlayFab Installation Complete!  

## Set up your first API call

This guide will provide the minimum steps to make your first PlayFab API call, without any GUI or on-screen feedback. Confirmation will be done with a console print statement.

1. In Visual Studio, Create a new C++ Console Application.

2. Open up the main cpp document for this project (by default it would be `ConsoleApplication1.cpp` unless you renamed your project).

3. Replace the contents of that file with the content shown below.

```cpp
// ConsoleApplication1.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
//

#include "playfab/PlayFabError.h"
#include "playfab/PlayFabClientDataModels.h"
#include "playfab/PlayFabClientApi.h"
#include "playfab/PlayFabSettings.h"
#include <windows.h>

using namespace PlayFab;
using namespace ClientModels;

bool finished = false;

void OnLoginSuccess(const LoginResult& result, void* customData)
{
    printf("Congratulations, you made your first successful API call!\n");
    finished = true;
}

void OnLoginFail(const PlayFabError& error, void* customData)
{
    printf("Something went wrong with your first API call.\n");
    printf("Here's some debug information:\n");
    printf(error.GenerateErrorReport().c_str());
    printf("\n");
    finished = true;
}

int main()
{
    PlayFabSettings::titleId = ("144");

    LoginWithCustomIDRequest request;
    request.CreateAccount = true;
    request.CustomId = "GettingStartedGuide";

    PlayFabClientAPI::LoginWithCustomID(request, OnLoginSuccess, OnLoginFail);

    while (PlayFabClientAPI::Update() != 0)
        Sleep(1);

    printf("Press enter to exit\n");
    getchar();
    return 0;
}
```

## Finish and execute

1. Run this project by selecting **Debug** (drop-down) -> **Start Debugging**.

1. When it loads, you should see the following text: "Congratulations, you made your first successful API call!"  

2. Start making other API calls, and build your game.

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of all available client API calls, see our [PlayFab API References](../../api-references/index.md) documentation. Happy coding!

## Deconstruct the code

This optional last section describes each part of `ConsoleApplication1.cpp` in detail.

- Includes PlayFab access to the Client APIs.
  - In this example, `Windows.h` is only used for `Sleep()`.

- Using namespaces in PlayFab and PlayFab::ClientModels.
  - PlayFab is used for API methods and general PlayFab usage.
  - PlayFab::ClientModels is used for the objects sent to and received by Client API calls.

- `OnLoginSuccess`, `OnLoginFailure` are callback functions asynchronously invoked by `PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithCustomID`.
- `main()`
  - `PlayFabSettings::titleId = WidenString("144");`
    - Every PlayFab developer creates a title in Game Manager. When you publish your game, you must code that `titleId` into your game. This lets the client know how to access the correct data within PlayFab. For most users, just consider it a mandatory step that makes PlayFab work

  - `LoginWithCustomIDRequest request;` (and field initialization)
    - Most PlayFab API methods require input parameters, and those input parameters are packed into a request object
    - Every API method requires a unique request object, with a mix of optional and mandatory parameters
      - For `LoginWithCustomIDRequest`, there is a mandatory parameter of `CustomId`, which uniquely identifies a player and `CreateAccount`, which allows the creation of a new account with this call.

    - For login, most developers will want to use a more appropriate login method
      - See the [PlayFab Login documentation](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication) for a list of all login methods, and input parameters. Common choices are:
        - [LoginWithAndroidDeviceID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithandroiddeviceid)
        - [LoginWithIOSDeviceID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithiosdeviceid)
        - [LoginWithEmailAddress](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithemailaddress)

  - `PlayFabClientAPI::LoginWithCustomID(request, OnLoginSuccess, OnLoginFail);`
    - Triggers the threaded API call. When complete, `OnLoginSuccess` or `OnLoginFail` will be invoked appropriately.

  - While `(PlayFabClientAPI::Update() != 0) Sleep(1);`
    - Update returns the number of API calls that are in progress.
    - Update also executes the actual calls to `OnLoginSuccess` or `OnLoginFail`, once the threaded API calls are complete.
      - This allows your callbacks to execute in a thread-safe manner, when your program is inherently single-threaded.
      - True multi-threaded options are also available, but not demonstrated here.

  - Inside of `OnLoginSuccess`:
    - The result object of many API success callbacks will contain the requested information
    - `LoginResult` contains some basic information about the player, but for most users, login is simply a mandatory step before calling other APIs.

  - Inside of `OnLoginFailure`:
    - API calls can fail for many reasons, and you should always attempt to handle failure.
    - Why API calls fail (In order of likelihood)
      - `PlayFabSettings.TitleId` is not set. If you forget to set `titleId` to your title, then nothing will work.
      - Request parameters. If you have not provided the correct or required information for a particular API call, then it will fail. See `error.errorMessage`, `error.errorDetails`, or `error.GenerateErrorReport()` for more info.
      - Device connectivity issue. Cell phones lose/regain connectivity constantly, and so any API call at any time can fail randomly, and then work immediately after. Going into a tunnel can disconnect you completely.
      - PlayFab server issue. As with all software, there can be issues. See our [release notes](../../release-notes/index.md) for updates.
      - The internet is not 100% reliable. Sometimes the message is corrupted or fails to reach the PlayFab server.

    - If you are having difficulty debugging an issue, and the information within the error information is not sufficient, please visit us on our [forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html)
