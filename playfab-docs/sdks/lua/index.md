# Lua

![Lua](./media/lua1.png)

Our Lua SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization. With the Lua SDK, you gain support for [Defold](https://www.defold.com/) and [Corona](https://coronalabs.com) game engines.

This Lua SDK was auto-generated by our [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every week, to keep up-to-date with the latest API changes.
