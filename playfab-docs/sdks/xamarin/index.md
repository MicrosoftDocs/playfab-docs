# Xamarin (C#)

![Xamarin](./media/xamarin1.png)

Our Xamarin SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization. This SDK uses the C# SDK. You will need to follow the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md) to get it setup for Xamarin.

This SDK was auto-generated by our [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs weekly to keep up-to-date with the latest API changes.
