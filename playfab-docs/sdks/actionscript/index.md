# ActionScript

![ActionScript](./media/flash1.png)

Our ActionScript SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, and an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests and JSON serialization.

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs on a weekly basis, to remain current with the latest API changes.
