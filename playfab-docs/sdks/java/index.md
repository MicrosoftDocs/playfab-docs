Our Java SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization. This is the same SDK used in the [Android Project](../androidstudio/index.md).

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every week, to remain current with the latest API changes.
