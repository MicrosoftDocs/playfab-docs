Our JavaScript SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

This SDK was auto-generated by our [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every week, to remain current with the latest API changes.

This SDK can alternatively be obtained via our CDN. Additional details can be found [here](https://playfab.com/playfab-now-serving-javascript-sdk-via-cdn/).

This SDK can alternatively be obtained via NPM using the command `npm install playfab-web-sdk`.
