Our C# SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

This SDK was auto-generated by our SDKGenerator. We generally build SDKs on a weekly basis, to remain current with the latest API changes.
