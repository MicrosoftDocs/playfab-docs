# NodeJS

![NodeJS](./media/nodejs1.png)

Our Node.js SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

This SDK was auto-generated by our [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every week, to remain current with the latest API changes. This SDK can also be obtained via the `npm install playfab-sdk` command.
