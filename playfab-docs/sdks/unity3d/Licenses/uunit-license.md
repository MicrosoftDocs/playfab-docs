## UUnit

https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html


Unity has a custom license and subscription, linked to their editor.

https://unity3d.com/get-unity

We are not distributing the Unity-editor, or any Unity source.

We are distributing a unity-example-project and PlayFab add-on for Unity.

The PlayFab code can be examined with any text editor, but the project can only be opened with a properly licensed Unity3d editor, version 5.x or higher.
