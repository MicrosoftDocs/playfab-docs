# Unity3D (C#)

![Unity3d Software](./media/unity-logo-main-page-new.png)

Our Unity3d SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

This SDK was auto-generated by our [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs weekly to remain current with the latest API changes.

Check out our [Editor Extensions](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnityEditorExtensions) for the easiest and fastest way to get started using PlayFab in Unity. This tool provides a UI for managing SDK settings, as well as an automatic SDK upgrade ability to stay current with the latest APIs.
