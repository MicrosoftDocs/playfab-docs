>This is a community supported SDK. Information on this page is no longer maintained and updated.

To learn how you can contribute and provide support for this SDK, refer to the ReadMe at [Objective-C PlayFab SDK repo](https://github.com/PlayFab/Objective_C_SDK/).

The team at Microsoft would no longer be providing official support for those using this SDK. You can continue to get community support and updates at [PlayFab forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html).

>[!Note]
>This topic provides information about the original version of the SDK and does not apply to the newer community versions.

Our Objective-C SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization. This SDK allows you to build native iOS apps in Object-C, and have access to the PlayFab service.
