# Postman quickstart

This quickstart helps you set up the all-inclusive PlayFab Postman collection. The collection contains files that will help you make your first PlayFab API call using Postman.

Before you can call any PlayFab API, you must have a [PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). 

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic PlayFab topics.

- A machine running TLS v1.2 or better to connect to the PlayFab service.

- Windows 7 or newer.

- [Transport Layer Security Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/secauthn/transport-layer-security-protocol)

- [Support for SSL/TLS protocols on Windows](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/kaushal/archive/2011/10/02/support-for-ssl-tls-protocols-on-windows.aspx)

## Setup

- Download and extract the [PostMan collection](https://github.com/PlayFab/PostmanCollection) to `{PostmanLocation}`.
- Load Postman from the Google Chrome App Launcher.
- Import `{PostmanLocation}/playfab.json` into Postman.

## Troubleshooting
