# Unreal Engine (C++, Blueprints)

![Unreal Engine 4](./media/unreal_banner1.png)

Our Unreal Marketplace plugin provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization. There is a C++ interface, and a Blueprint interface, giving you the best of both worlds.

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every week, in an effort to remain current with the latest API changes.
