# Push notifications for Android

## Prerequisites

- [Push Notifications quickstart](quickstart.md)
- [Unity3D quickstart](../../../sdks/unity3d/quickstart.md)
- [Optional] [Unity Editor Extensions](https://blog.playfab.com/blog/new-unity-editor-extensions-beta)
- [Optional] [Executing the PlayFab API via Postman](../../../sdks/postman/executing-the-playfab-api-via-postman.md)

## Configuring the Android notification channel

> [!NOTE]
> The Google and Firebase developer consoles experience changes regularly. The setup description in this section best describes the values you need - and how to get them - as of June 2017.

### Google and Firebase setup

There are three Google websites that you must use and synchronize. In Google/Firebase, there are both Projects and Apps:

- **Project**:
  - Ensure that your project is set up and accessible from the [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/).
  - Import your project into the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) if it's not already there.

- **App**:
  - [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) Projects contain apps.
  - The [Google Play Dev Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) also contains apps.
  - Make sure your app exists in both locations, with the same name and identifier (for example, [Unicorn Battle and com.playfab.unicornbattle2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playfab.unicornbattle2)).

### PlayFab requires a server API key

- You can get this key from the [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/), or from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- **Google API Manager**:
  - Select your **Project**.
  - Select **Credentials** (left menu).
  - The **Firebase Project** import will have created a **ServerKey** for you here.
- **Firebase Console**:
  - Select your **Project** or **App**, and find the **Settings** option (there are many ways to do this, all of which lead you to the same place).
  - In the **General** tab, this is listed as the **Web API Key**.
  - In the **Cloud Messaging** tab, this is listed as the **Legacy server key**.

- All of the keys described above should be identical, and they are all the API key described in this document.

> [!NOTE]
> If they are not identical, the **Legacy server key** is the one needed by PlayFab.

## Using the API key

- Provide your API key in one of two ways:
  1. Input your key directly into the **Game Manager UI**: **Settings** (for your **Title**) > **Push Notifications** > **Android**.
  2. Or call [SetupPushNotification](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.title-widedatamanagement.setuppushnotification) using Postman or a Unity project with Server API methods enabled.
  
  - Name: **your_game_name**
  - Platform: **GCM**
  - Credential: (**Google server API Key**): `AIza**ppo`
  - Overwrite OldARN: `true`
  - You should receive an **HTTP 200 OK** response with data similar to the following.

      ```json
      // Postman JSON result output
      {
          "code": 200,
          "status": "OK",
          "data": { "ARN" : "arn:*******/GCM/your_game_name" }
      }
      ```

- Once set up properly (using either method), you should see this in the **Game Manager UI** **Settings (for your title) > Push Notifications > Android**.

## Getting started: push notifications for Android + Unity

To set up your Unity project:

- Create a new Unity project.
- [OPTIONAL] Import the [PlayFab Unity Editor Extensions](https://aka.ms/playfabunityextension) package.
- Import the [Unity PlayFab SDK](https://aka.ms/playfabunitysdkdownload) package.
- Follow the [FCM Unity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/unity/client) guide to install FCM messaging, and set up a project for push notifications.
  - Once finished, you can continue with this guide to receive messages from PlayFab.
  - We will give you a complete FCM-ready monoBehaviour script in the following example, which combines FCM and PlayFab.

- In the FCM guide, you created a monobehavior script that set up the Firebase plugin.
  - You can continue using that monobehavior script, or replace it with the one in the example that follows.

### Setting up your first Push Notification

In Unity, open the script you created in the FCM tutorial, and replace the contents.

```csharp
using PlayFab;
using PlayFab.ClientModels;
using PlayFab.Json;
using UnityEngine;

public class MsgCatcher : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string pushToken;
    public string playFabId;
    public string lastMsg;

    // OnGUI should be deleted/replaced with your own gui - This is only provided for debugging
    public void OnGUI()
    {
        GUI.Label(new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, 200), pushToken);
        GUI.Label(new Rect(0, 200, Screen.width, Screen.height - 200), lastMsg);
    }

    private void OnPfFail(PlayFabError error)
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayFab: api error: " + error.GenerateErrorReport());
    }

    public void Start()
    {
        // PlayFabSettings.TitleId = "TITLE_ID";
        Firebase.Messaging.FirebaseMessaging.TokenReceived += OnTokenReceived;
        Firebase.Messaging.FirebaseMessaging.MessageReceived += OnMessageReceived;
        LoginToPlayFab();
    }

    private void LoginToPlayFab()
    {
#if UNITY_ANDROID
        var request = new LoginWithAndroidDeviceIDRequest { AndroidDeviceId = SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier, CreateAccount = true, };
        PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithAndroidDeviceID(request, OnPfLogin, OnPfFail);
#endif
    }

    private void OnPfLogin(LoginResult result)
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayFab: login successful");
        playFabId = result.PlayFabId;
        RegisterForPush();
    }

    private void RegisterForPush()
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(pushToken) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(playFabId))
            return;

#if UNITY_ANDROID
        var request = new AndroidDevicePushNotificationRegistrationRequest {
            DeviceToken = pushToken,
            SendPushNotificationConfirmation = true,
            ConfirmationMessage = "Push notifications registered successfully"
        };
        PlayFabClientAPI.AndroidDevicePushNotificationRegistration(request, OnPfAndroidReg, OnPfFail);
#endif
    }

    private void OnPfAndroidReg(AndroidDevicePushNotificationRegistrationResult result)
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayFab: Push Registration Successful");
    }

    private void OnTokenReceived(object sender, Firebase.Messaging.TokenReceivedEventArgs token)
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayFab: Received Registration Token: " + token.Token);
        pushToken = token.Token;
        RegisterForPush();
    }

    private void OnMessageReceived(object sender, Firebase.Messaging.MessageReceivedEventArgs e)
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayFab: Received a new message from: " + e.Message.From);
        lastMsg = "";
        if (e.Message.Data != null)
        {
            lastMsg += "DATA: " + JsonWrapper.SerializeObject(e.Message.Data) + "\n";
            Debug.Log("PlayFab: Received a message with data:");
            foreach (var pair in e.Message.Data)
                Debug.Log("PlayFab data element: " + pair.Key + "," + pair.Value);
        }
        if (e.Message.Notification != null)
        {
            Debug.Log("PlayFab: Received a notification:");
            lastMsg += "TITLE: " + e.Message.Notification.Title + "\n";
            lastMsg += "BODY: " + e.Message.Notification.Body + "\n";
        }
    }
}
```

Build and run your Unity project on a device. If you receive a push notification with the text, **Push notifications registered successfully**, then everything worked as expected.

> [!NOTE]
> `PlayFabSettings.TitleId = TITLE_ID`.
> You must set your own `TitleId`. This example will not work if you don't update this `TitleId`, because our title is registered with our Firebase Keys and settings, *not yours*. You can do so by un-commenting this line and replacing `TITLE_ID` with your `titleId`, or you can choose your title from the optional Editor Extensions plugin mentioned in the previous section.

### Troubleshooting Android

- Verify that you can send a test push notifications from the Firebase Console.
  - If you cannot, then your Firebase plugin is not set up correctly, and you should review the Firebase Documentation to find out why, or contact Firebase Support.

- Ensure your FCM client pushToken is set properly.
  - The `OnTokenReceived` function in the example should be called, and should have a valid token.
  - If it is *not* called, your Firebase plugin is *not* set up correctly, and you should review the Firebase Documentation to find out why, or contact Firebase Support.

- Ensure your `titleId` is set to a title that you own, and that it has been registered with the server API key from your Firebase project.

### Advanced Features

In **server.[SendPushNotification](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification)**, you can use **[request.Package](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification#pushnotificationpackage).CustomData** to deliver arbitrary data to the device. In the example previously, this is delivered to the section with the following comment.

```csharp
 Debug.Log("PlayFab: Received a message with data:");
```

You can customize your client receiver to utilize that data however you like. **CustomData** is not displayed to the player, so it can be used to deliver custom game information to your client, or to locally schedule another future notification using the **FCM** plugin.

You can also use **[request.Package](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification#pushnotificationpackage).CustomData** or request **[AdvancedPlatformDelivery](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification#advancedpushplatformmsg)** to deliver to many 3rd party plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> 3rd party plugin delivery is not supported or guaranteed, but is available for advanced users.
