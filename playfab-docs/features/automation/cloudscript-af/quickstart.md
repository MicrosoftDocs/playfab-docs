# Getting Started

There are two ways to get started with C# CloudScript using Azure Functions.  The easiest and quickest way is to use Azure Functions right out of the box.  To get started with Azure Functions with either Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio visit their [getting started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/) and return here once you are completely setup.

>**NOTE:**
>In this guide, we will focus only on using Visual Studio Code. You can use any  [language that is supported in Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages).  At this time, the samples we provide with PlayFab integration uses the C# language.

What is the difference between the two?  The main difference is that our Visual Studio Code Extension provide some easy ways to registers and unregister functions with your PlayFab title. However, you do not need the extension to do this as there is a user interface for it in [Game Manager](https://developer.playfab.com/login).  We will cover more about this below.

### Prerequisites

There are a couple of steps needed to get started with PlayFab C# CloudScript.

* You must have an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) already setup.  Signing up for an Azure Account is free.
* You must have an [Azure Subscription setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-create-subscription), Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time. Visit [Cancel Azure Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-cancel-azure-subscription) for more info.
* **Note:** To minimize latency of your CloudScript using Azure Functions place them in either US-West or US-West 2 Azure regions.   
* You must have a [PlayFab account](https://developer.playfab.com/signup). 
* While we do support all languages that Azure Functions support, our documentation samples are in C#.
* PlayFab Azure Functions use V2 of Azure Functions, so please be sure to use the V2 runtime.

### Enable the Feature

To begin using this feature you need to enable it.  Visit Automation -> CloudScript tab -> Functions (Preview).

* Click the Enable button to turn on the various pieces of Game Manager that will allow you to register functions, hook them up to rules, tasks etc.

### Create an Azure Function

1. Following the Visual Studio Code getting started guide create a basic "HelloWorld" example function.  You can see how to do this by following the [Create your first function using Visual Studio Code guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code).  For a code example using PlayFab variables see the section below **(PlayFab Function Context, Variables and using the Server SDKs)**.
2. Once your function has been created and deployed, click the Register Function button in the top right hand corner of the Functions (Preview) page.

3. Put the name and Function URL.  The URL can be found in the output of your deployment.

> **TIP**: To learn more about deploying azure functions, see [Deploy Azure Functions from Visual Studio Code]](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/functions-extension/deploy-app).

### Using and Calling CloudScript using Azure Functions from your PlayFab Title

In order to use the function you just created from the PlayFab SDK, you will need to download one of our BetaSDKs.  These are gated SDKs, and you will need to request access to them via [helloplayfab@microsoft.com](mailto:helloplayfab@microsoft.com).  Once you have access to the [Beta SDKs](https://github.com/PlayFab?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=beta&type=&language=) you can download the one specifically for the environment you are making your game in.  

> **NOTE:** The examples code within the this guide will be written in Unity C# & Azure Function C# code.

Now that your function is registered, and you have the Beta SDK installed, you can now call that function from within your client.

```C#
//This snippet assumes that your game client is already logged into PlayFab.

using PlayFab;

private void CallCSharpExecuteFunction(){
    
    PlayFabCloudScriptAPI.ExecuteFunction(new ExecuteFunctionRequest(){
        EntityKey = new CloudScriptModels.EntityKey(){
            Id = [AuthenticationContext.Entity.Id], //Get this from when you logged in,
            Type = [Authenticationcontext.Entity.Type] //Get this from when you logged in
        }, 
        FunctionName = "HelloWorld", //This should be the name of your Azure Function that you created.
        FunctionParameter = new Dictionary<string,object>(){
            {"inputValue": "Test"}
        }, //This is the data that you would want to pass into your function.
        GeneratePlayStreamEvent:false, //Set this to true if you would like this call to show up in PlayStream
    }, (ExecuteFunctionResult result)=>{
        if(result.FunctionResultTooLarge){
            Debug.Log("This can happen if you exceed the limit that can be returned from an Azure Function, See PlayFab Limits Page for details.")
            return;
        }
        Debug.Log($"The {result.FunctionName} function took {result.ExecutionTimeMilliseconds} to complete");
        Debug.Log($"Result: {result.FunctionResult.toString()}");
    },(PlayFabError error)=>{
        Debug.Log($"Opps Something went wrong: {error.GenerateErrorReport()}");
    });

} 

```

### PlayFab Function Context, Variables and using the Server SDKs

One advantage of using CloudScript using Azure Functions is that some data will be automatically passed to the Azure Function, passing you context on the invocation of the Cloudscript and in what context the Function was called (For example, PlayStream Action or directly from the client). This includes information like the entity profile that was the CloudScripts was invoked on behalf of and potentially the PlayStream events used to invoke the CloudScript.

There are a couple of steps that you need to do if you are coding Functions without our Visual Studio Code Extension. 

1. You will need to install the PlayFab SDK via Package Manager. To do this open Terminal or CMD Console in Visual Studio Code and type: `dotnet add package PlayFabAllSDK`
2. We have created some helpers that will ship with the cSharpSDK,  they are in beta.  If you have access to the beta repository, then you can get the cloudscript project.  If not, you can copy the file *PlayFabFunctionContexts.cs* from the [pf-af-samples](https://github.com/PlayFab/pf-af-samples) repository.
3. You need to edit your .csproj file and include `<DefineConstants>NETCOREAPP2_0</DefineConstants>` in your default PropertyGroup.
![Define Constants](media/define_constants.jpg)

A hello world example is always nice,  see the below HelloWorld Sample that you can use as your first Azure Function.

```C#
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using PlayFab;
using PlayFab.Plugins.CloudScript;

namespace PlayFabCS2AFTests.HelloWorld
{
    public static class HelloWorld
    {
        [FunctionName("HelloWorld")]
        public static async Task<dynamic> Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequestMessage req,
            ILogger log)
        {
            /* Create the function execution's context through the request */
            var context = await FunctionContext<dynamic>.Create(req);
            var args = context.FunctionArgument;

            var message = $"Hello {context.CurrentPlayerId}!";
            log.LogInformation(message);

            dynamic inputValue = null;
            if (args != null && args["inputValue"] != null)
            {
                inputValue = args["inputValue"];
            }

            log.LogDebug($"HelloWorld: {new { input = inputValue} }");

            return new { messageValue = message };
        }
    }
}

```

As you can see in the above, the CurrentPlayerId of the caller is available like in our traditional CloudScript implementation.  Parameters you have passed in the FunctionParameters field will be available in the *args*.

> **NOTE:** You will need to call this HelloWorld Azure Function via ExecuteFunction from an SDK.

> **NOTE:** In the PlayStream event, sent back from the CloudScript function, the Player Profile is returned.  If the returned Player Profile is over 2048 bytes then the profile will be truncated with a property set indicating it has been truncated.  If this occurs you will need to use the profile APIs (either server, client or entity APIs) to retrieve the full profile.

### Azure Function Rules

Azure Functions can also be called by creating rules and scheduled tasks.  This works in the same way as our standard CloudScript.  To create a rule, go to Automation->Rules  or Automation->Scheduled Tasks. 

* Click **New Rule**
* Enter a name for your rule
* Select the event type that this rule will trigger on
* Add an action
* From the action dropdown select **Execute Azure Function**

A list of available Azure Functions that you've registered will be available in the drop-down list.

### Debugging your Azure Function

With Azure Functions, you can now test and debug your CloudScript code locally.  Here is a great guide on how to [test and debug your Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local) locally.

Here are some highlights from the above document.

* Make sure that your Azure Functions Core Tools are installed.
* Configure your [Local Settings File](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=nodejs#local-settings-file)
* Set a break point in your code
* Select **F5** to start debugging
