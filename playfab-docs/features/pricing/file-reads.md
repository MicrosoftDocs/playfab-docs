# File Reads

Files include the following items: entity files, actions, rules, scheduled tasks, matchmaking, push notifications, emails, and title news. Files are a set of key/value pairs that are primarily used to manage configuration for your game remotely.

The following APIs cause the File reads meter to increment.

## General

- [GetContentUploadUrl](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/playfab/admin/content/getcontentuploadurl?view=playfab-rest)
    Retrieves the pre-signed URL for uploading a content file. A subsequent HTTP PUT to the returned URL uploads the content. Also, please be aware that the Content service is specifically PlayFab's CDN offering, for which standard CDN rates apply
