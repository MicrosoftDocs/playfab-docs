# Pricing meters
PlayFab's pricing is calculated from a set of consumption-based meters. This page describes the full set of PlayFab's pricing meters and how they are measured and calculated. For more information on PlayFab's pricing model, see [PlayFab Pricing Overview](../../pricing/pricing-overview.md).
> [!NOTE]
> This page does not include add-ons (for example, Community Sift, Snowflake, and Photon) and is subject to change as new services and capabilities are added to PlayFab.

## Core meters <!--The subheadings and descriptions that follow don't look like meters.  -->
PlayFab Events, Profile, and Content & Configuration are the services that make up the core PlayFab product. Most PlayFab features use a mix of functionality across the core services and accrue usage against one or more core meters. 

### Events
View and take action on your game's real-time data. Events can be generated in two ways. Standard events are automatically generated by PlayFab Game Services APIs and written to the event pipeline. Custom events can be created to trigger specific actions within the event pipeline. <!--Please introduce the two concepts that follow. For example, are they the two main types of events, or are they (in keeping with the sentence) custom events?--> 
* **PlayStream Events**: PlayStream unifies your game data into a single stream and allows you to trigger player-engagement actions. These events show up in the PlayStream Monitor to provide real-time visualization of event data. For more information, see [PlayStream Event Model reference](../../../api-references/events/index.md).
* **Telemetry Events**: Telemetry events are custom events that bypass PlayStream and go straight to the data warehouse. For more information, see [PlayStream Events - Write Telemetry Events](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.events.playstreamevents.writetelemetryevents).

<!-- > [!NOTE] 
> The size of the event is uncompressed and only includes the payload -->
>  [!NOTE]
> Events are metered in 1-KB blocks against average event size. For example, 10 events with an average size of 2 KB are billed as 20 events, but 10 events with an average size of 0.5 KB are billed as 10 events.

#### Example of a calculation of weighted meters <!--Changed "events" to "meters", for consistency with the sentence below -->
<!-- Removed "To get a better understanding of how weighted meters are calculated" as redundant text-->Let's take a look at a sample title's PlayStream Events consumption for the previous month:

Event Name | Count | Size
--- | :---: | :---:
player_leveled_up | 40 | 50 KB
player_bought_item | 30 | 10 KB
player_statistic_changed | 20 | 30 KB
player_executed_cloudscript | 10 | 20 KB

By adding up the total size of 110 KB and dividing by the total count of 100, we get an average size of 1.1 KB. Therefore, to get the effective count of 110 PlayStream Events, we need to multiply the total count by 1.1. 

Let's look at the same example with some adjusted numbers:

Event Name | Count | Size
--- | :---: | :---:
player_leveled_up | 40 | 40 KB
player_bought_item | 30 | 10 KB
player_statistic_changed | 20 | 20 KB
player_executed_cloudscript | 10 | 20 KB

By adding up the total size of 90 KB<!--"By adding up the total size of 90 KB" is unclear. Are we adding up all events' sizes?--> and dividing it by the total count of 100, we get an average size of 0.9 KB. Therefore, we don't multiply the total count by anything; we stick with 100 PlayStream Events even though the player_executed_cloudscript event had an average size greater than 1 KB.

### Profile
There is nothing more important to the success of your games than your players. The Profile is what helps you understand and engage with your players. It includes any stored data related to the player profile, entity profile, character profile, groups membership, and inventory. Data reads, writes, and storage are billed as part of this metered service.
* **Reads** are metered based on the total number of reads to<!--of?--> profile data that are processed by PlayFab. For a list of read APIs, see [Profile read APIs](profile-reads.md). This meter is weighted to 1 KB.
* **Writes** are metered based on the total number of writes (and deletes) processed by PlayFab. For a list of write APIs, see [Profile write APIs](profile-writes.md). This meter is weighted to 1 KB.
* **Storage** is metered based on the average total volume of profile data hosted by PlayFab across daily snapshots.

### Content & Configuration
Content & Configuration files are used to remotely manage configuration for your game. You can update game content remotely and in real time (or on a schedule), and you can deliver personalized news and events that keep players coming back for more. Content & Configuration files include the following items: entity files, actions, rules, scheduled tasks, matchmaking, push notifications, emails, and title news. Content & Configuration files are a set of key/value pairs that are primarily <!--"primarily" in what sense? Can we omit this word?-->used to manage configuration for your game remotely. File data reads, writes, and storage are billed as part of this metered service.
* **Reads** are metered based on the total number of file data reads processed by PlayFab. For a list of read APIs, see [Content & Configuration read APIs](file-reads.md). This meter is weighted to 10 KB.
* **Writes** are metered based on the total number of file data writes and deletes processed by PlayFab. For a list of write APIs, see [Content & Configuration write APIs](file-writes.md).
* **Storage** is metered based on the average total volume of file data hosted by PlayFab across daily snapshots.

## Service-specific meters<!--None of the subheadings and descriptions that follow are meters. I think they are the services that we meter. -->
The following services are metered directly, in addition to any usage they accrue against core meters.
### CloudScript
CloudScript enables you to use client code to request execution of any custom server-side functionality you can implement. CloudScript enables you to build server-side logic and functionality that scales to meet your demand; you no longer have to worry about servers or infrastructure. Both the total number of CloudScript executions and the corresponding execution time are billed as part of this metered service:<!--In the list, I switched Total Executions and Execution Time to stay consistent with how they are presented in this sentence.-->
* **Total Executions**: This is the total number of `ExecuteFunction` API calls processed by PlayFab, including the calls triggered by actions, rules, and scheduled tasks. For more information on how executions can occur, see [Server-Side Cloud Script - Execution Function](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.cloudscript.server-sidecloudscript.executefunction), [Actions & Rules](../../automation/actions-rules/index.md), and [Scheduled Tasks](../../automation/scheduled-tasks/index.md).
* **Execution Time**: CloudScript execution time is metered based on the per-second <!--per-millisecond?-->consumption of resources (measured in GB) across all CloudScript executions: average memory size in GB x total execution time in milliseconds.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The minimum billable memory size and the time per execution are 128 MB and 100 milliseconds, respectively.

### Insights
Real-time analytics give you immediate insight into a game's performance and potential issues. Insights shed light on performance of a data warehouse, long-term storage of data, custom visualization technology, managed external data sources, specialized data projects, and more. The total combined usage of Insights products, represented by the aggregate value of Insights Credits, is billed as part of this metered service. Insights Credits are derived from conversion rates for usage of each Insights service.
* **Insights Credits**<!--We started talking about Insights Credits earlier, so it's not clear why it's defined here. Also, please state the relationship between Insights and Insights Credits. For example, is Insights Credits a component of Insights, and if so, are there any other components?-->: The total number of Insights Credits used across all Insights products. For a detailed breakdown of how Insights Credits are calculated, see [Insights Pricing](../../Insights/pricing.md).

### Multiplayer Servers
PlayFab Multiplayer Servers deliver secure and reliable low-latency gameplay at global scale. Multiplayer Servers facilitate interoperable multiplayer infrastructure and cross-network gameplay, and they enable you to operate a dynamically scaling pool of custom game servers in Azure.
<!--Please introduce the two concepts that follow--> 
* **Virtual Machine Instance Hours**: The hours of virtual machine time that your game servers use, including overhead hours generated by standby servers and virtual machine fragmentation. Price varies by data center, virtual machine, and container selection<!--selected? Is it necessary here?-->. For more information, see [Multiplayer Servers detailed price sheet](../../multiplayer/servers/multiplayer-servers-detailed-price-sheet.md).
* **Network Egress**: The volume of data (in GB), transmitted by your game servers to the Internet. Network egress is billed according to the originating data center. Price varies by zone.

### Party
PlayFab Party is a low-latency chat and data communication solution for cross-platform and cross-device multiplayer games. The voice and text features in Party can be used as a standalone chat solution or in conjunction with other features in PlayFab's Multiplayer product. There are four key meters used to bill the usage of Party:

* **Connectivity** is metered according to the number of minutes a player is connected to a network. Metering starts when a player creates or joins a network, and it stops when the player disconnects.<!--"the number of player minutes connected to a network" was unclear. Edited to clarify.-->
* **Voice** is metered according to the number of minutes a player has been speaking. When a player is connected to a network and is actively speaking, the player's voice activity is measured and metered.<!--"the number of player minutes speaking" was unclear. Edited to clarify.-->
* **Cognitive Services** is metered by the number of minutes a player has been using the Speech to Text, Text to Speech, or Translation feature.<!--"the number of player minutes using" was unclear. Edited to clarify.-->
* **Network Egress** is the data sent from PlayFab's relay and voice servers. It is congruent with the aggregate amount of data that players receive from the network.

> [!NOTE]
> Party Network Egress is metered and priced separately from Multiplayer Servers Network Egress.
