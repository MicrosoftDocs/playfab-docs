# PlayFab Pricing Overview

> [!WARNING]
> PlayFab customers on the legacy pricing model, which is based on Monthly Active Users (MAU), will need to update their account plans to the modern pricing model prior to **10/31/2020** at which time MAU based pricing will no longer be supported. **[Learn how to update your account's pricing](../pricing/transition.md)**.<!-- 10/31/2020 is too far in the past. I think we can remove the first sentence and keep just the linked text.-->
