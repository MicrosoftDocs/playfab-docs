# Coupons and Promotions

**Coupons** are string tokens that are generated by you for your customers use to redeem **Inventory Items** in their **Game**. Combined with **Bundles** or **CloudScript**, these **Coupons** could be used to trigger almost any functionality in your **Game**.

## Requirements

- Familiarity with [Catalogs](../items/catalogs.md), **Bundles**, and **Containers**.
- Familiarity with [Game Manager](../../config/gamemanager/quickstart.md).
- Familiarity with [Player Inventory](../../data/playerdata/player-inventory.md).

## Generate and Redeem Coupon Instructions

All of the examples that follow share the first basic step of generating a **Coupon**. This is done in **Game Manager**.

From your **Game Manager**:

- Navigate to your **Title**.
- Select **Economy** from the menu to the left.
- Go to your **Catalogs** tab.

For any of the three tab-sections: **Items**, **Bundles**, and **Containers**, you will find a **Coupons** button.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalog Items - Coupons button](media/tutorials/game-manager-catalog-items-coupon-button.png)  

This opens a window which lets you generate **Coupons** for any of the **Items** in the section. If you wish to create **Coupons** for a specific **Item**:

- Select **Coupons** in the **Items** tab.
- Bundle **Coupons** under **Bundles**, and Container **Coupons** under **Containers**.

The pop-up window is similar to the one we have provided below (your list of **Items** will match your **Title**, the displayed **Items** are described in our [Drop Tables](../items/drop-tables.md) tutorial).

To complete the **Coupon** generation:

- Select a quantity of **Coupons** to generate.

- Then select the **Item** the **Coupons** should generate. 
- This will download a **CSV** text file with a list of **Coupons**.

Selecting one of the links in the example generates the following ten comma-separated **Coupons**.

```xml
65g-d4q5-zph,ahs-aofk-5ip,rqp-pk6c-yuu,58d-64h9-a6q,zxk-jtmi-5a1,oeu-6e4z-365,mfy-euhb-qj3,ru9-r1ux-wzy,shj-54cm-5oh,719-7hxc-pzz
```

Finally, the customer can redeem a **Coupon** if you provide a **GUI** which lets them input the code, which then calls [RedeemCoupon](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playeritemmanagement.redeemcoupon).

```csharp
// Unity/C#
void UseCoupon(string couponCode)
{
    var primaryCatalogName = "TestCatalog-001"; // In your game, this should just be a constant matching your primary catalog
    var request = new RedeemCouponRequest
    {
        CatalogVersion = primaryCatalogName,
        CouponCode = couponCode // This comes from player input, in this case, one of the coupon codes generated above
    };
    PlayFabClientAPI.RedeemCoupon(request, LogSuccess, LogFailure);
}
```

### Example Case: Inventory Item Coupon

The most straightforward way to use **Coupons** is gifting an **Inventory Item**. Once you have created your **Catalog**, you can generate **Coupons** for regular **Items** by following the previous instructions we have already discussed. There are no other special steps for this case.

### Example Case: Virtual Currency Coupon **or**  Multiple-Item Coupon

**Coupons** cannot grant [Virtual Currency](currencies.md) directly, and they can only grant a single **Item**.

However, **Bundles** can be used to convert **Inventory Items** seamlessly into **Groups** of **Items** or **Virtual Currency**. In the **VC** example, you should create a new **Bundle Item**, with **VC** contents.

Set the **Bundle** to expire in **15 seconds**.  This way, the **Player** will immediately see the **VC** as soon as they open the **Bundle**, and they won't see the intermediate item.

Multiple items work the same way:

- Create a **Bundle** with multiple items - or even [Drop Tables](../items/drop-tables.md).
- Set it to expire in **15 seconds**.
- The **Coupon** can generate the **Bundle**.
- The **Bundle** is then converted to multiple **Items**.
- The intermediate **Bundle Item** disappears.

## Usage Scenarios

- Physical rewards at conventions:
  - Print out your list of **Coupon** codes, and hand them out as swag at conventions.
- Out-of-Game communication such as **Forums**, **[Push Notifications](../../engagement/push-notifications/quickstart.md)** and **Email**.
  - Send your players **Coupon** codes directly as part of re-acquisition campaigns or other community outreach.
- Tournaments:
  - Send **Coupons** to the top ranked **Players** when using [Resettable Leaderboards](../../social/tournaments-leaderboards/using-resettable-statistics-and-leaderboards.md).
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also give out inventory items directly in this case, so pick whichever is more relevant to your game.

## Best practices

Using the **PlayFab** inventory, you should keep **Inventory** sizes relatively small - *less than 100 items total* per **Player**.

A **Bundle** which grants *too many items* may be throttled or rate-limited.
