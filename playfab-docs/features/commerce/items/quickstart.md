# Items quickstart

The Items quickstart gives you the building blocks of your in-game economics: virtual currency, catalogs, items, and purchases.

In this quickstart, you will:

- Set up a virtual currency for your game.
- Give virtual currency to a player.
- Add an item to your in-game catalog.
- Use PlayFab APIs to purchase an item from the catalog using virtual currency.
- Use information in the Game Manager to confirm that the purchase was successful.

## Setting up a virtual currency

PlayFab supports a robust game economy with multiple currencies and items.

To access these features and create a virtual currency:

1. Open **Game Manager** and select **Economy** on the left side bar.
2. Select the **Currency** tab, and select **New Currency**. (This opens the **New Currency** screen shown below).
3. To create your virtual currency, edit these fields:

   - Set **Currency code (2 uppercase characters)** to **GD**.
   - Set **Display name** to **Gold**.
4. Select **SAVE CURRENCY**.

## Giving virtual currency to a player

You can give players virtual currency directly. As an example, let's add money to a player using the Game Manager:

1. Select **Players** on the left side bar, then select the **ID** of a player.
2. Go to the player's **Virtual Currency** tab.
3. Choose the **GD** currency. (This opens the **Modify Virtual Currency** screen shown below).
4. Change the **Amount** to **100**.
5. Select **SAVE VIRTUAL CURRENCY**.

> [!TIP]  
> It can be dangerous to give clients the ability to call the [AddUserVirtualCurrency](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playeritemmanagement.adduservirtualcurrency) API. To set restrictions on specific APIs, use the [API access policy](../../config/gamemanager/api-access-policy.md).

Now the player has 100 gold. What can they do with it? Buy an item!

## Adding an item to your in-game catalog

No sense having money if you can't spend it! Let's create a catalog, (which is a collection of items).

You can create catalogs that correspond to the platforms on which you're releasing your game, or major version numbers - whatever you like.

> [!TIP]
> We don't recommend creating multiple catalogs to differentiate types of items. You can filter items more effectively using classes, tags, and stores.

To make a catalog with an item:

1. Select **Economy** on the left side bar and select the **Catalogs** tab.
2. Select the **New Catalog** button and enter **main** as the **Catalog version**. An item with the ID of **One** is added automatically.
3. Select **One**. (This opens the **Edit Catalog Item** screen shown below). Edit these fields:

   - Set **Item ID** to **apple**.
   - Set **Display name** to **apple**.
   - Set **Description** to **Perfectly normal apple**.

At the bottom of the form is the **PRICES** section, where you define how much an item costs in your game's virtual currency.

1. Set the apple's price in gold (**GD**) to **5**.
2. Select **SAVE ITEM**.

## Purchasing an item using virtual currency

Let's use the PlayFab APIs to make a purchase in your game.

1. Log in as the player that was assigned 100 gold in virtual currency (as described in [Giving virtual currency to a player].
2. Call [GetCatalogItems](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.title-widedatamanagement.getcatalogitems) with the following parameter in the request:
   - `CatalogVersion = "main"`

3. Verify that the `Catalog` in the result contains an **apple** with a **GD** price of **5**.
4. Purchase the apple by calling [PurchaseItem](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playeritemmanagement.purchaseitem) with these parameter values in the request:

   - `CatalogVersion = "main"`
   - `ItemId = "apple"`
   - `VirtualCurrency = "GD"`
   - `Price = 5`

5. Finally, call [GetUserInventory](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playeritemmanagement.getuserinventory) and take a look at the result of that method. In the array of items in the player's inventory, you should see an apple!

## Confirming that the purchase was successful

To confirm the purchase in Game Manager:

1. Select **Players** from the left side bar to open the **Players** tab.
2. Select the **ID** of the player that purchased the item.

Check the following:

- Open the **PlayStream** tab. You should see a [Player virtual currency item purchased](../../../api-references/events/player-vc-item-purchased.md) event.
- Open the **Inventory** tab. The inventory should now contain an apple. You can also use features on the **Inventory** tab to revoke the item, or grant the player *more* apples.
- Open the **Virtual Currency** tab. The player should only have 95 gold left.
