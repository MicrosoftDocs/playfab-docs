# Available built-in entity types

This topic describes the available entity types that you can use to construct an [EntityKey](../../../api-references/events/data-types/entitykey.md).

Entity keys identify entities in most of the newer API methods.

You use the value of the `EntityKey.Type` field to determine the type of value to set in the `ID` field.

> [!NOTE]
> Entity keys are *case sensitive*.

## namespace

The `namespace` entity refers to *all* global information for all titles within your studio.

> [!NOTE]
> Changes to this entity are *not* reflected in real time.

Set the `ID` field to your game's **Publisher ID**. To retrieve your **Publisher ID**:

- Sign in to [Game Manager](https://playfab.com/).
- In the upper left-hand corner of **Game Manger**, select the gear icon.
- Select **Title Settings**.
- Select **API Features**.
- The **Publisher ID** is displayed in the **API ACCESS** section.

## title

The `title` entity refers to all global information for that title.

> [!NOTE]
> Changes to this entity are *not* reflected in real time.

Set the `ID` field to your game's **Title ID**. To retrieve the **Title ID**:

- Sign in to [Game Manager](https://playfab.com/).
- In the upper left-hand corner of **Game Manger**, select the gear icon.
- Select **Title Settings**.
- Select **API Features**.
- The **Title ID** is displayed in the **API ACCESS** section.

## master_player_account

The `master_player_account` is a player entity that is shared by all titles within your studio.

Set the `ID` field to the `LoginResult.PlayFabId` from the classic API. To retrieve the `LoginResult`, call one of the login methods in [Client Authentication](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication).

## title_player_account

For most developers, `title_player_account` represents the player in the most traditional way.

Set the `ID` field to `LoginResult.EntityToken.Entity.Id` in the client API, or `GetEntityTokenResponse.Entity.Id` in the authentication API.

To retrieve the `LoginResult`, call one of the login methods in [Client Authentication](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication).
To retrieve the `GetEntityTokenResponse`, call [Get Entity Token](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.authentication.authentication.getentitytoken).

## character

The `character` entity is a sub-entity of `title_player_account`, and is a direct mirror of [Characters in the Classic APIs](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.characters.getalluserscharacters).

Set the `ID` field to any `characterId` from `result.Characters[i].CharacterId`.

## group

The `group` entity is a container  for other entities. It is currently limited to players and characters.

Set the `ID` field to the `result.Group.Id` if you are creating a group, or the `result.Groups[i].Group.Id` when [listing your memberships](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.groups.groups.listmembership).

## service

The `service` entity is reserved for internal use.
