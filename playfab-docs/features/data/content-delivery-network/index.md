# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

The Content Delivery Network (CDN) is an infrastructure used to deliver assets (images, audio, binary content, etc) to the end user that focuses on speed and availability.

CDN costs are independent from your tier (Essentials, Professional, etc.) and require a payment account to be set up with PlayFab.

This can be done by entering your credit card information in the **Admin**->**Billing** tab of your title. CDN costs are based on your usage.

> [!NOTE]
> Please use the **Content**->**File Management** tab for more information on this subject, or contact our [developer forum](https://community.playfab.com/) with any questions that you may have.
