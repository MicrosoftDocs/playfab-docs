# About the events.all table

The events.all table is the destination for all incoming events regardless of the ingestion pipeline they come through. This table powers several features on Game Manager, including Event History and Explorer.

> [!NOTE]
> Many columns present are written as an artifact of our ingestion process and are in the process of being deprecated. Only those listed below are intended to remain. Other columns can and should be disregarded.

| Column Name                           | Data Type   | Description                                                                       |
