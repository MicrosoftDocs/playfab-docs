# PlayFab Explorer

> [!NOTE]
> The PlayFab Explorer feature is in public preview. We anticipate ongoing changes to it as we continue gathering feedback and optimizing for customer use.

## Overview

The PlayFab Explorer is the primary window into event data collected by your title and services. The data is stored in PlayFab Insights, an in-development offering designed to provide a complete back-end solution for data and analytics. For more information on the PlayFab Insights vision and strategy, see our [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaCZHrQg_-qPrYIVsTFuUHg). 

Explorer is designed to let you discover insights in your event data using the [Azure Data Explorer query language](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/write-queries) â€“ a SQL-like language optimized for ad hoc data exploration. 

Explorer provides fast indexing and querying on large, diverse data sets. For optimized queries, the engine can query millions of records in a few seconds - a critical capability for games producing high throughput or large volumes of gaming events.

Explorer uses a simplified SQL-like language that's easy to pick up and learn. The [intellisense](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/write-queries) capabilities make it possible for users of all skill levels to author complex queries and [render](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/kusto/query/renderoperator) the results in-line.
