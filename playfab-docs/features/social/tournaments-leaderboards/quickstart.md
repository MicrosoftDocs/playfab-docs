# Tournaments and leaderboards quickstart

This quickstart describes how to have a statistic that keeps track of the players high score, and how to get a leaderboard of the top high scores. This can be utilized for a global leaderboard, or in conjunction with [resettable statistics](using-resettable-statistics-and-leaderboards.md) to reset for a specific event or tournament.

## Prerequisites

Your player is already logged into PlayFab.  

## Step 1 - Create a statistic and associated leaderboard

In the Game Manager:
- Go to **Leaderboards** in the menu to the left.
- Select **NEW LEADERBOARD**.
- Add a **Leaderboard** called **HighScore** in the **Statistic name** field.
- Using the drop-down menu provided, set the **Reset frequency** field to **Manually**.
- Move to the **Aggregation method** field and select **Maximum** (always use the highest value) from the drop-down menu provided.

## Step 2 - Update the statistic with the high score for a player

Before we can use [UpdatePlayerStatistics](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.updateplayerstatistics) from the client, we must enable it in **API Features**.

1. Select **Title settings** off the Settings menu for your title.
2. Select the **API Features** tab.
3. Check the box for **Allow client to post player statistics**.
4. Click the **SAVE** button at the bottom of the screen.

### C# code example - SubmitScore

In this code example we will have a `SubmitScore` function that would be called at the end of a game.

```csharp

public void SubmitScore(int playerScore) {
    PlayFabClientAPI.UpdatePlayerStatistics(new UpdatePlayerStatisticsRequest {
        Statistics = new List<StatisticUpdate> {
            new StatisticUpdate {
                StatisticName = "HighScore",
                Value = playerScore
            }
        }
    }, result=> OnStatisticsUpdated(result), FailureCallback);
}

private void OnStatisticsUpdated(UpdatePlayerStatisticsResult updateResult) {
    Debug.Log("Successfully submitted high score");
}

private void FailureCallback(PlayFabError error){
    Debug.LogWarning("Something went wrong with your API call. Here's some debug information:");
    Debug.LogError(error.GenerateErrorReport());
}
```

### Step 3 - Request the leaderboard for the high score

In order to get the leaderboard of the top high scores of all players that have played the game, you will make a call to [GetLeaderboard](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.getleaderboard).

### C# code example - RequestLeaderboard

In this code example we will have a `RequestLeaderboard` function that would be called to get the leaderboard, and will pass the results to a function of `DisplayLeaderboard`, which would populate the experience in your game that shows the high scores.

```csharp
//Get the players with the top 10 high scores in the game
public void RequestLeaderboard() {
    PlayFabClientAPI.GetLeaderboard(new GetLeaderboardRequest {
            StatisticName = "HighScore",
            StartPosition = 0,
            MaxResultsCount = 10
            }
        }
    }, result=> DisplayLeaderboard(result), FailureCallback);
}


private void FailureCallback(PlayFabError error){
    Debug.LogWarning("Something went wrong with your API call. Here's some debug information:");
    Debug.LogError(error.GenerateErrorReport());
}
```
