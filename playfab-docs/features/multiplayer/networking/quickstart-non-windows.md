# Getting started with the Party SDK

This quickstart is intended to be a high-level overview of the facets of PlayFab Party. PlayFab Party was designed to be cross-platform from the ground up. We've structured these quickstarts in the same way, where most of the information applies to all platforms, and platform-specific prerequisites and steps are described in the linked documents.

In this quickstart, critical pieces of functionality are highlighted via explanatory text and code snippets. However, please note that this is not a step-by-step walk-through. Please consult the linked reference and conceptual documentation, as well as refer to the source code of the demo sample for different platforms that comes with the Party libraries, for a deeper understanding.

## Requirements for Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android

This document lists the basic prerequisites necessary to integrate PlayFab Party into your specific platform applications. 

Before you start this tutorial, ensure that the following prerequisites have been met by consulting the following platform specific documents:

1. [Android-specific requirements](android-specific-requirements.md)

2. [iOS-specific requirements](ios-specific-requirements.md)

3. [Nintendo Switch specific Requirements](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFabPartySwitch/releases)

Once you've finished the platform-specific steps, please continue with the rest of the steps in this document to set up PlayFab Party.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow these steps to [Enable PlayFab Party](enable-party.md).

## Log into your PlayFab title and obtain an entity token and entity ID

In order to initialize and use Party, it is a requirement to log in to PlayFab. You can use [PlayFabClientAPI::LoginWithCustomID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithcustomid)
 or any other login method to do this. 
Once you execute login, you'll be returned an entity ID and entity token as part of the [LoginResult](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithcustomid#loginresult).

These two key pieces of information are later utilized to initialize a Local user instance for PlayFab Party. The relevant code snippet is below and as always, please refer to the demo sample code in PlayFabManager.cpp

```cpp
PlayFabClientAPI::LoginWithCustomID(
        loginRequest,
        [this, callback, userId](const LoginResult& loginResult, void*)
        {
            // Sign in was successful.
            DEBUGLOG("PlayFab::signin -- Login with custom id callback\n");

            // Save the PlayFab id and entity data for Party authentication.
            m_playfabId = loginResult.PlayFabId;
            if (loginResult.EntityToken.notNull() && loginResult.EntityToken->Entity.notNull())
            {
                m_entityKey = loginResult.EntityToken->Entity;
                m_entityToken = loginResult.EntityToken->EntityToken;
            }
```

Once you've successfully obtained the entity ID and entity token from PlayFab, you're all set to proceed with enabling and then initializing Party.

## Initialize PlayFab Party

Before proceeding with this section, it is recommended that you read through [Understanding Party conceptual documentation.](concepts-objects.md) and the code comments in the public Party.h header.

Initializing Party is done via the NetworkManager.cpp code that's provided as part of the Party Demo Apps, and is common to all platforms. 

At a high level, initializing Party involves the following steps:

1. Get a singleton reference to the PartyManager, the primary management class for interacting with the Party library, and initialize it.

```cpp
    auto& partyManager = PartyManager::GetSingleton();
    PartyError err;

    //Only initialize the party manager once.
    if (m_partyInitialized == false)
    {
        // Initialize PlayFab Party
        err = partyManager.Initialize(titleId);
        if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
        {
            DEBUGLOG("Initialize failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
            return;
        }

        m_partyInitialized = true;
    }
```

2. Create a local User object. The local user object that is used to represent a local user on the device (phone or console) when performing networking and chat operations. The local user object is initialized with the PlayFab Entity ID.

```cpp
    //Only create a local user object if it doesn't exist.
    if (m_localUser == nullptr)
    {
        PartyString entityId = Managers::Get<PlayFabManager>()->EntityId().c_str();
        PartyString entityToken = Managers::Get<PlayFabManager>()->EntityToken().c_str();

        // Create a local user object
        err = partyManager.CreateLocalUser(
            entityId,                                   // User id
            entityToken,                                // User entity token
            &m_localUser                                // OUT local user object
        );

        if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
        {
            DEBUGLOG("CreateLocalUser failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
            return;
        }
    }
```

3. Create a chat control. The chat control object manages the chat operations for the user on the specific device. You also set the audio input and output channel where Party will receive or forward data.

```cpp
    // Only create local chat controls if they don't exist.
    if (m_localChatControl == nullptr)
    {
        PartyLocalDevice* localDevice = nullptr;

        // Retrieve the local device
        err = partyManager.GetLocalDevice(&localDevice);

        if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
        {
            DEBUGLOG("GetLocalDevice failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
            return;
        }

        // Create a chat control for the local user on the local device
        err = localDevice->CreateChatControl(
            m_localUser,                                // Local user object
            m_languageCode,                             // Language id
            nullptr,                                    // Async identifier
            &m_localChatControl                         // OUT local chat control
        );

        if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
        {
            DEBUGLOG("CreateChatControl failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
            return;
        }

        // Use system default settings for the audio input device
        err = m_localChatControl->SetAudioInput(
            PartyAudioDeviceSelectionType::SystemDefault,   // Selection type
            nullptr,                                        // Device id
            nullptr                                         // Async identifier
        );

        if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
        {
            DEBUGLOG("SetAudioInput failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
            return;
        }

        // Use system default settings for the audio output device
        err = m_localChatControl->SetAudioOutput(
            PartyAudioDeviceSelectionType::SystemDefault,   // Selection type
            nullptr,                                        // Device id
            nullptr                                         // Async identifier
        );

        if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
        {
            DEBUGLOG("SetAudioOutput failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
        }
```

4. Finally, set the transcription and translation options.

```cpp
        // Get the available list of text to speech profiles
        err = m_localChatControl->PopulateAvailableTextToSpeechProfiles(nullptr);

        if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
        {
            DEBUGLOG("Populating available TextToSpeechProfiles failed: %s \n", GetErrorMessage(err));
        }

        // Set transcription options for transcribing other users regardless of language, and ourselves.
        PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionOptions transcriptionOptions =
            PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionOptions::TranscribeOtherChatControlsWithMatchingLanguages |
            PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionOptions::TranscribeOtherChatControlsWithNonMatchingLanguages |
            PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionOptions::TranslateToLocalLanguage |
            PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionOptions::TranscribeSelf;

        // Set the transcription options on our chat control.
        err = m_localChatControl->SetTranscriptionOptions(
            transcriptionOptions,                       // Transcription options
            nullptr                                     // Async identifier
        );

        if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
        {
            DEBUGLOG("SetTranscriptionOptions failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
        }

        // Enable translation to local language in chat controls.
        err = m_localChatControl->SetTextChatOptions(
            PartyTextChatOptions::TranslateToLocalLanguage,
            nullptr
        );
```

Please refer to the NetworkManager::Initialize() code in [NetworkManager.cpp](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFabParty/blob/docs/android/PartySampleNetworkCommon/lib/NetworkManager.cpp) in the demo app for a complete sample.


At this point, you have the PlayFab Party initialized in your application or game. The next step is to Create and Connect to a Party Network. Before proceeding further, you should have a basic understanding of the various [PlayFab Party objects and their relationships](concepts-objects.md#network).

## Create a Party Network

A Party Network is a  secured collection of one or more devices and their authorized users that the game creates for the purpose of exchanging chat or data communication. This typically aligns with a game's multiplayer session or chat "lobby" concept. You can
only send messages to players inside your own network.

The following code snippet shows how we can create a Party Network.

```cpp
    // Initialize an empty network descriptor to hold the result of the following call.
    PartyNetworkDescriptor networkDescriptor = {};

    // Create a new network descriptor
    err = PartyManager::GetSingleton().CreateNewNetwork(
        m_localUser,                                // Local User
        &cfg,                                       // Network Config
        0,                                          // Region List Count
        nullptr,                                    // Region List
        &invitationConfiguration,                   // Invitation configuration
        nullptr,                                    // Async Identifier
        &networkDescriptor,                         // OUT network descriptor
        nullptr                                     // applied initialinvitationidentifier.
    );
```

Once the function call to CreateNewNetwork() succeeds, a network descriptor [PartyNetworkDescriptor](concepts-objects.md#network
) object will be returned/populated. The descriptor contains the data required by other players to connect to a network. Please refer to the [API Reference Documentation] for a detailed discussion of the other function parameters.

## Connect to a Party network

Once a Party network has been created and you have a network descriptor, the next step is to somehow broadcast this network descriptor to other users such that they can join. This is where PlayFab Matchmaking or any matchmaking service can come into play. 

We implemented simple matchmaking using [PlayFab CloudScripts](../../automation/cloudscript/quickstart.md) in the demo samples, which work as follows:
   
1. The user creating the network creates a json key value pair with a room number as key and the network descriptor as value. 
   
2. They store this json object in playfab backend via a CloudScript function `save_network_descriptor`. 
   
3. Any player that wishes to join the same network (abstracted away through the concept of a chat room), queries for the network descriptor associated with the room they seek to join. This is accomplished via calling the CloudScript function `get_network_descriptor`.

The full code of the CloudScript functions are given below for reference:

``` javascript
 
// Used to store a network descriptor on the server retrievable by the roomId
// Inputs:
//    roomId - The hash key used to store and retrieve the network descriptor.
//    networkDescriptor - The network descriptor used to connect to a party network.
//
handlers.save_network_descriptor = function (args, context) 
{
  if (args && args.hasOwnProperty("roomId"))
  {
    var roomId = args.roomId;
  }
  else
  {
    return;
  }
  
  if (args && args.hasOwnProperty("networkDescriptor"))
  {
    var networkDescriptor = args.networkDescriptor;
  }
  else
  {
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    server.CreateSharedGroup({ SharedGroupId: roomId });
  } catch(err) {
    log.info("Shared group " + roomId + " could not be created.");
    log.error(err);
  }

  var updateRequest = {
    SharedGroupId: roomId,
    Data: {
      "network": networkDescriptor
    }
  };

  server.UpdateSharedGroupData(updateRequest);
};

//
// Used to retrieve a previously stored network descriptor by roomId.
// Inputs:
//    roomId - The hash key used to store and retrieve the network descriptor.
//
handlers.get_network_descriptor = function (args, context) 
{
  if (args && args.hasOwnProperty("roomId"))
  {
    var roomId = args.roomId;
  }
  else
  {
    return;
  }
  
  try 
  {
    var getRes = server.GetSharedGroupData({ SharedGroupId: roomId });
    return getRes.Data;
  } 
  catch(err) 
  {
    return;
  }
};
```

Once each player has a way to retrieve the network descriptors by selecting a room and calling the CloudScript functions, they can use the network descriptor thus retrieved to join the Party Network. 

The following steps are required to successfully join a PlayFab Party Network:

1. Retrieve the network descriptor as a string by executing the above-mentioned PlayFab CloudScript function.

2. Deserialize the network descriptor from the network descriptor string.

3. Connect to the Party Network.

4. Authenticate the local user for the network.

5. Connect the local chat control to the network so that we can use VOIP.

6. Establish a [Party Network endpoint](concepts-objects.md#endpoint) for game message traffic.

```cpp
    PartyNetworkDescriptor networkDescriptor = {};

    // Deserialize the remote network's descriptor
    PartyError err = PartyManager::DeserializeNetworkDescriptor(descriptor, &networkDescriptor);

    if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
    {
        DEBUGLOG("ConnectToNetwork failed to deserialize descriptor: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
        errorCallback(err);
        return;
    }

    // This portion of connecting to the network is the same for
    // both creating a new and joining an existing network.

    PartyError err = PartyManager::GetSingleton().ConnectToNetwork(
        &descriptor,                                // Network descriptor
        nullptr,                                    // Async identifier
        &m_network                                  // OUT network
    );

    if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
    {
        DEBUGLOG("ConnectToNetwork failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
        errorCallback(err);
        return false;
    }

    // Authenticate the local user on the network so we can participate in it
    err = m_network->AuthenticateLocalUser(
        m_localUser,                                // Local user
        networkId,                                  // Invitation Id
        nullptr                                     // Async identifier
    );

    if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
    {
        DEBUGLOG("AuthenticateLocalUser failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
        errorCallback(err);
        return false;
    }

    // Connect the local user chat control to the network so we can use VOIP
    err = m_network->ConnectChatControl(
        m_localChatControl,                         // Local chat control
        nullptr                                     // Async identifier
    );

    if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
    {
        DEBUGLOG("ConnectChatControl failed: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
        errorCallback(err);
        return false;
    }

    // Establish a network endoint for game message traffic
    err = m_network->CreateEndpoint(
        m_localUser,                                // Local user
        0,                                          // Property Count
        nullptr,                                    // Property name keys
        nullptr,                                    // Property Values
        nullptr,                                    // Async identifier
        &m_localEndpoint                            // OUT local endpoint
    );

    if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
    {
        DEBUGLOG("Failed to CreateEndpoint: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
        errorCallback(err);
        return false;
    }
```

## Send a message to another network device or endpoint

Once you've connected your device to the Party Network, you can send a message using the local endpoint object. The full code is available in NetworkManager.cpp

```cpp
    if (m_localEndpoint && m_state == NetworkManagerState::NetworkConnected)
    {
        auto packet = message.Serialize();

        // Form the data packet into a data buffer structure
        PartyDataBuffer data[] = {
            {
                static_cast<const void*>(packet.data()),
                static_cast<uint32_t>(packet.size())
            },
        };

        // Set delivery options for guaranteed and sequential delivery.
        PartySendMessageOptions deliveryOptions =
            PartySendMessageOptions::GuaranteedDelivery |
            PartySendMessageOptions::SequentialDelivery;

        // Send out the message to all other peers
        PartyError err = m_localEndpoint->SendMessage(
            0,                                      // endpoint count; 0 = broadcast
            nullptr,                                // endpoint list
            deliveryOptions,                        // send message options
            nullptr,                                // configuration
            1,                                      // buffer count
            data,                                   // buffer
            nullptr                                 // async identifier
        );

        if (PARTY_FAILED(err))
        {
            DEBUGLOG("Failed to SendMessage: %s\n", GetErrorMessage(err));
        }
    }
```

## Receive a message and render it on the local device

The final step is receiving messages sent by remote Party members and rendering (playing) them on your device. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While creating the chat control in one of the previous steps, you've already set up the audio input and output devices which will be used by Party to send, receive and render audio data. To receive the audio messages, in addition to setting the chat control with right audio input/output setup, you'll need to set the appropriate chat permission between each chat control if you want audio to flow. By default, the chat permissions are set to NONE. For more information, please refer to the [Chat Permissions](concepts-chat-permissions-and-muting.md) article.

The processing of other messages from the Party layer is best accomplished in an update or game loop. The game loop should be set up to run every frame and receive messages from the Party Manager via the StartProcessingStateChanges() function. 

A complete description of all the state changes is beyond the scope of this document and you should refer to the [Party Reference Documentation](party-reference.md) for details of each state. Alternatively, you can refer to the NetworkManager.cpp in the demo sample for an example of how to process each state change.

## Conclusion

In this quickstart, we walked through the key pieces of PlayFab Party and saw examples of how to interact with them. We encourage you to take a look at the complete Reference and Conceptual documentation for a deeper understanding of the systems.
