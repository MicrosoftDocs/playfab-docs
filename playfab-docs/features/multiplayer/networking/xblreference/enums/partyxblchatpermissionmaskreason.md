# PartyXblChatPermissionMaskReason  

Reasons communication may be restricted.    

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
enum class PartyXblChatPermissionMaskReason    
{  
    NoRestriction = 0,  
    Determining = 1,  
    Privilege = 2,  
    Privacy = 3,  
    InvalidTargetUser = 4,  
    XboxLiveServiceError = 5,  
    UnknownError = 6,  
    ResolveUserIssue = 7,  
}  
```  
  
## Constants  
  
| Constant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NoRestriction | There is no restriction currently applying to this chat permission. |  
| Determining | Communication is restricted while the local chat user's communication privilege and privacy settings are being queried. |  
| Privilege | Communication is restricted due to the local chat user's communication privilege.<br/><br/> If the Microsoft Game Core version of the library generates this mask, the app can call XUserResolvePrivilegeWithUiAsync with XUserPrivilegeOptions::None and XUserPrivilege::Communications to attempt to resolve the issue. The user may be unable or unwilling to resolve the issue. If the user does resolve the issue, the user's chat permission will be updated and a new PartyXblRequiredChatPermissionInfoChangedStateChange state change will be generated. |  
| Privacy | Communication is restricted due to the local chat user's privacy settings in relation to the target chat user. |  
| InvalidTargetUser | Communication is restricted because the target user was not recognized as valid by Xbox Live services. |  
| XboxLiveServiceError | The required chat permission could not be successfully determined due to issues with Xbox Live services. |  
| UnknownError | The required chat permission could not be successfully determined due to an unknown internal error. |  
| ResolveUserIssue | Communication is restricted due to a failure in retrieving the user's privileges.<br/><br/> This mask reason will only be generated by the Microsoft Game Core version of the library. The library on other platforms will only ever generate the Privilege mask reason to expose privilege errors. The app can call XUserResolveIssueWithUiAsync with nullptr for the URL parameter to attempt to resolve the issue. The user may be unable or unwilling to resolve the issue. If the user does resolve the issue, the user's chat permission will be updated and a new PartyXblRequiredChatPermissionInfoChangedStateChange state change will be generated. |
