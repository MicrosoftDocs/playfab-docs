# PartyEndpointStatistic  

Types of statistics that can be retrieved for an endpoint.    

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
enum class PartyEndpointStatistic    
{  
    CurrentlyQueuedSendMessages,  
    CurrentlyQueuedSendMessageBytes,  
    CurrentlyActiveSendMessages,  
    CurrentlyActiveSendMessageBytes,  
    TimedOutSendMessages,  
    TimedOutSendMessageBytes,  
    CanceledSendMessages,  
    CanceledSendMessageBytes,  
}  
```  
  
## Constants  
  
| Constant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CurrentlyQueuedSendMessages | The number of messages currently queued by [PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_sendmessage.md) but not yet transmitted from the local endpoint to the specified target endpoints.<br/><br/> For efficiency, only a single message is queued by PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage() when sending to multiple target endpoints at once via the transparent cloud relay server. If two or more of those endpoints are specified to [PartyLocalEndpoint::GetEndpointStatistics()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_getendpointstatistics.md) when querying for this statistic, the message will only be counted a single time rather than multiplied per target endpoint. |  
| CurrentlyQueuedSendMessageBytes | The number of bytes of data in messages currently queued by [PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_sendmessage.md) but not yet transmitted from the local endpoint to the specified target endpoints.<br/><br/> For efficiency, only a single message is queued by PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage() when sending to multiple target endpoints at once via the transparent cloud relay server. If two or more of those endpoints are specified to [PartyLocalEndpoint::GetEndpointStatistics()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_getendpointstatistics.md) when querying for this statistic, the message bytes will only be counted a single time rather than multiplied per target endpoint. |  
| CurrentlyActiveSendMessages | The number of [PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_sendmessage.md) messages from the local endpoint to the specified target endpoints that are currently being transmitted or still have more local state changes to be processed.<br/><br/> A message is considered "active" as soon as its first byte has been placed in a packet that is being transmitted. It remains active until transmission completes and the local [PartyDataBuffersReturnedStateChange](../structs/partydatabuffersreturnedstatechange.md) for it (if applicable) has been returned to [PartyManager::FinishProcessingStateChanges()](../classes/PartyManager/methods/partymanager_finishprocessingstatechanges.md). <br /><br /> For efficiency, only a single message is tracked per PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage() when sending to multiple target endpoints at once via the transparent cloud relay server. If two or more of those endpoints are specified to [PartyLocalEndpoint::GetEndpointStatistics()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_getendpointstatistics.md) when querying for this statistic, the message will only be counted a single time rather than multiplied per target endpoint. |  
| CurrentlyActiveSendMessageBytes | The number of bytes of data in [PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_sendmessage.md) messages from the local endpoint to the specified target endpoints that are currently being transmitted or still have more local state changes to be processed.<br/><br/> A message is considered "active" as soon as its first byte has been placed in a packet that is being transmitted. It remains active until transmission completes and the local [PartyDataBuffersReturnedStateChange](../structs/partydatabuffersreturnedstatechange.md) for it (if applicable) has been returned to [PartyManager::FinishProcessingStateChanges()](../classes/PartyManager/methods/partymanager_finishprocessingstatechanges.md). <br /><br /> For efficiency, only a single message is tracked per PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage() when sending to multiple target endpoints at once via the transparent cloud relay server. If two or more of those endpoints are specified to [PartyLocalEndpoint::GetEndpointStatistics()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_getendpointstatistics.md) when querying for this statistic, the message bytes will only be counted a single time rather than multiplied per target endpoint. |  
| TimedOutSendMessages | The total number of [PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_sendmessage.md) messages from the local endpoint to the specified target endpoints that were ever discarded for exceeding their send queue timeouts without being transmitted.<br/><br/> A message's send queue timeout is specified using [PartySendMessageQueuingConfiguration::timeoutInMillseconds](../structs/partysendmessagequeuingconfiguration.md) when calling PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage(). <br /><br /> For efficiency, only a single message is queued by PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage() when sending to multiple target endpoints at once via the transparent cloud relay server. If two or more of those endpoints are specified to [PartyLocalEndpoint::GetEndpointStatistics()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_getendpointstatistics.md) when querying for this statistic, the message will only be counted a single time rather than multiplied per target endpoint.   <br /><br /> When querying this statistic for all target endpoints by providing a zero-entry array to PartyLocalEndpoint::GetEndpointStatistics(), note that only endpoints that currently exist will be included. If an endpoint that had timed out messages gets destroyed between queries, this count might be perceived as "going backward". |  
| TimedOutSendMessageBytes | The total number of bytes of data in [PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_sendmessage.md) messages from the local endpoint to the specified target endpoints that were ever discarded for exceeding their send queue timeouts without being transmitted.<br/><br/> A message's send queue timeout is specified using [PartySendMessageQueuingConfiguration::timeoutInMillseconds](../structs/partysendmessagequeuingconfiguration.md) when calling PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage(). <br /><br /> For efficiency, only a single message is queued by PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage() when sending to multiple target endpoints at once via the transparent cloud relay server.

If an endpoint that had timed out messages gets destroyed between queries, this count might be perceived as "going backward". |  
| CanceledSendMessages | The total number of [PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_sendmessage.md) messages from the local endpoint to the specified target endpoints that were ever canceled.<br/><br/> Messages are canceled before being transmitted by the application calling PartyLocalEndpoint::CancelMessages() with a matching filter expression. <br /><br /> For efficiency, only a single message is queued by PartyLocalEndpoint::SendMessage() when sending to multiple target endpoints at once via the PartyNetwork transparent cloud relay server. If two or more of those endpoints are specified to [PartyLocalEndpoint::GetEndpointStatistics()](../classes/PartyLocalEndpoint/methods/partylocalendpoint_getendpointstatistics.md) when querying for this statistic, the message will only be counted a single time rather than multiplied per target endpoint.   <br /><br /> When querying this statistic for all target endpoints by providing a zero-entry array to PartyLocalEndpoint::GetEndpointStatistics(), note that only endpoints that currently exist will be included.
