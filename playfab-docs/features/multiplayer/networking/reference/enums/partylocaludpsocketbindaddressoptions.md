# PartyLocalUdpSocketBindAddressOptions  

Additional options to control how the Party library binds to the UDP socket specified by the [PartyLocalUdpSocketBindAddressConfiguration](../structs/partylocaludpsocketbindaddressconfiguration.md) structure.    

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
enum class PartyLocalUdpSocketBindAddressOptions    
{  
    None = 0x0,  
    ExcludeGameCorePreferredUdpMultiplayerPort = 0x1,  
}  
```  
  
## Constants  
  
| Constant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None | No flags are specified. |  
| ExcludeGameCorePreferredUdpMultiplayerPort | In the Microsoft Game Core version of the Party library, when the *port* field of the [PartyLocalUdpSocketBindAddressConfiguration](../structs/partylocaludpsocketbindaddressconfiguration.md) structure is 0, this flag informs the Party library to not use the Game Core preferred UDP multiplayer port. In other versions of the Party library or if the *port* port is non-zero, this flag must not be set. |  
  
  
## Requirements
