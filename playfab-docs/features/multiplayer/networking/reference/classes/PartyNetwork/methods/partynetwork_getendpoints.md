# PartyNetwork::GetEndpoints  

Gets the endpoints in this network.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
PartyError GetEndpoints(  
    uint32_t* endpointCount,  
    PartyEndpointArray* endpoints  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
**`endpointCount`** &nbsp; uint32_t*  
*output*  
  
The output number of PartyEndpoint entries in the `endpoints` array.  
  
**`endpoints`** &nbsp; [PartyEndpointArray*](../../../typedefs.md)  
*library-allocated output array of size `*endpointCount`*  
  
A library-allocated output array containing the endpoints in this network.  
  
  
### Return value  
PartyError
  
```c_partyErrorSuccess``` if the call succeeded or an error code otherwise. The human-readable form of the error code can be retrieved via [PartyManager::GetErrorMessage()](../../PartyManager/methods/partymanager_geterrormessage.md).
  
## Remarks  
  
This method gets all endpoints currently associated with the network and visible to the local device. <br /><br /> All local endpoints that have successfully been created or are in the process of being created will be present in `endpoints`. All remote endpoints that have been successfully created will also be present.   <br /><br /> Once a [PartyEndpointDestroyedStateChange](../../../structs/partyendpointdestroyedstatechange.md) has been provided by [PartyManager::StartProcessingStateChanges()](../../PartyManager/methods/partymanager_startprocessingstatechanges.md), the endpoint will no longer be present in the array returned by this method.   <br /><br /> The memory for the returned array is invalidated whenever the title calls [PartyManager::StartProcessingStateChanges()](../../PartyManager/methods/partymanager_startprocessingstatechanges.md) or [CreateEndpoint()](partynetwork_createendpoint.md) returns success.
