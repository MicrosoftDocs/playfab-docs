# PartyManager::GetRegions  

Gets an array containing the set of regions for which your title is configured, along with roundtrip latency information.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
PartyError GetRegions(  
    uint32_t* regionCount,  
    const PartyRegion** regions  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
**`regionCount`** &nbsp; uint32_t*  
*output*  
  
The output number of regions provided in `regions`.  
  
**`regions`** &nbsp; [PartyRegion**](../../../structs/partyregion.md)  
*library-allocated output array of size `*regionCount`*  
  
A library-allocated output array containing the set of regions.  
  
  
### Return value  
PartyError
  
```c_partyErrorSuccess``` if the call succeeded or an error code otherwise. The human-readable form of the error code can be retrieved via [GetErrorMessage()](partymanager_geterrormessage.md).
  
## Remarks  
  
The array provided by this method is not populated until the first [PartyRegionsChangedStateChange](../../../structs/partyregionschangedstatechange.md) is provided. Each subsequent PartyRegionsChangedStateChange indicates an update to this set of regions. Background operations to populate this set begin when [Initialize()](partymanager_initialize.md) is called and, if this set hasn't yet been successfully populated, when [CreateNewNetwork()](partymanager_createnewnetwork.md) is called. <br /><br /> The array will be sorted in order of increasing latency. Latency for a region is defined as the end-to-end time it takes to send a UDP datagram to the PlayFab Quality of Service beacon for that region and receive a response. The library will measure latency for each region several times in order to calculate high fidelity results.   <br /><br /> A latency equivalent to UINT32_MAX indicates that the region is supported but latency information could not be determined, either due to failures internal to the library or a ping timeout was reached without receiving a response from the beacon. This can be used for diagnostic purposes (a UINT32_MAX latency to every region likely indicates a local configuration problem) or used to filter out regions that are unlikely to be viable during region selection.   <br /><br /> For efficiency, the library measures latency on several threads that are affinitized to the processor specified for the networking threads via [SetThreadAffinityMask()](partymanager_setthreadaffinitymask.md). The amortized worst-case time to complete latency measurements for each region is approximately 500 ms. The average time to complete latency measurements for each region will vary by network environment but will typically be much lower.
