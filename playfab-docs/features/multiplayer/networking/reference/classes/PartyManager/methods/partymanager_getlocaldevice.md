PartyError GetLocalDevice(  
    PartyLocalDevice** localDevice  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
**`localDevice`** &nbsp; [PartyLocalDevice**](../../PartyLocalDevice/partylocaldevice.md)  
*library-allocated output*  
  
The output local device.  
  
  
### Return value

The local device represents the physical device on which the title is executing, such as an Xbox One or PC.
