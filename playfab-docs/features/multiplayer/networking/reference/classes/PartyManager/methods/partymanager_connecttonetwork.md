# PartyManager::ConnectToNetwork  

Queues an asynchronous attempt to connect to a network.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
PartyError ConnectToNetwork(  
    const PartyNetworkDescriptor* networkDescriptor,  
    void* asyncIdentifier,  
    PartyNetwork** network  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
**`networkDescriptor`** &nbsp; [PartyNetworkDescriptor*](../../../structs/partynetworkdescriptor.md)  
  
The descriptor associated with the network to which a connection will be established.  
  
**`asyncIdentifier`** &nbsp; void*  
*optional*  
  
An optional, app-defined, pointer-sized context value that can be used to associate the completion state change with this call.  
  
**`network`** &nbsp; [PartyNetwork**](../../PartyNetwork/partynetwork.md)  
*optional, library-allocated output*  
  
The optional, output network object.  
  
  
### Return value  
PartyError
  
```c_partyErrorSuccess``` if the asynchronous operation to connect to a new network began, or an error code otherwise. If this method fails, no related state changes will be generated. The human-readable form of the error code can be retrieved via [GetErrorMessage()](partymanager_geterrormessage.md).
  
## Remarks  

This method queues an asynchronous attempt to connect to the network associated with `networkDescriptor` by negotiating and establishing a secure DTLS connection from the local device to the transparent cloud relay server. A [PartyConnectToNetworkCompletedStateChange](../../../structs/partyconnecttonetworkcompletedstatechange.md) will be provided upon completion of the asynchronous operation, indicating success or failure. On success, the local device will have established a connection to the transparent cloud relay server. On failure, a [PartyNetworkDestroyedStateChange](../../../structs/partynetworkdestroyedstatechange.md) will be generated. No other devices will become visible, and the local device will not be visible to any remote devices, until at least one local user is successfully authenticated via [PartyNetwork::AuthenticateLocalUser()](../../PartyNetwork/methods/partynetwork_authenticatelocaluser.md). <br /><br /> After the device successfully connects to the network, it must authenticate into the network via PartyNetwork::AuthenticateLocalUser(). If the device is connected to the network but unauthenticated for more than one minute, the device will be disconnected and a PartyNetworkDestroyedStateChange will be generated. This will occur regardless of whether the device never authenticated or lost authentication after calling [PartyNetwork::RemoveLocalUser()](../../PartyNetwork/methods/partynetwork_removelocaluser.md).   <br /><br /> This method optionally provides `network` as output that can immediately be used to perform asynchronous network operations, such as [PartyNetwork::CreateInvitation()](../../PartyNetwork/methods/partynetwork_createinvitation.md) and [PartyNetwork::CreateEndpoint()](../../PartyNetwork/methods/partynetwork_createendpoint.md). These asynchronous operations will be internally queued until the connection completes, at which point they will be processed. This `network` will also be provided on the resulting PartyConnectToNetworkCompletedStateChange where it will be fully-connected and associated with the provided `asyncIdentifier`.   <br /><br /> This operation will asynchronously fail with [PartyConnectToNetworkCompletedStateChange::result](../../../structs/partyconnecttonetworkcompletedstatechange.md) set to [PartyStateChangeResult::NetworkLimitReached](../../../enums/partystatechangeresult.md) if the limit of connected devices for the network has been reached as specified in the network's configuration when it was created via [CreateNewNetwork()](partymanager_createnewnetwork.md).   <br /><br /> On successful return, this method invalidates the memory for any array previously returned by [GetNetworks()](partymanager_getnetworks.md), as it synchronously adds the new network to the array. [StartProcessingStateChanges()](partymanager_startprocessingstatechanges.md) also invalidates the memory for the array. The returned `network` object will be valid until a PartyNetworkDestroyedStateChange has been generated and all state changes referencing the object have been returned to [FinishProcessingStateChanges()](partymanager_finishprocessingstatechanges.md).     

### Retrying on failure

 When ConnectToNetwork() fails asynchronously, a PartyConnectToNetworkCompletedStateChange is provided by StartProcessingStateChanges() indicating the result. The operation may be retried after a delay, depending on the [PartyStateChangeResult](../../../enums/partystatechangeresult.md) provided.   <br /><br />

| Result | Retry behavior |
| --- | --- |
| InternetConnectivityError | Retry with a small delay of no less than 10 seconds. For your app, it may be more appropriate to display the error to the user immediately, rather than retrying automatically. |
| PartyServiceError | Retry with an exponential backoff. Start with a minimum delay of no less than 10 seconds, doubling the delay with each retry. |
