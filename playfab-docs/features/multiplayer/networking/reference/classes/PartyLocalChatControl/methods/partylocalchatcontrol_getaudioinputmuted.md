# PartyLocalChatControl::GetAudioInputMuted  

Provides whether the user's audio input is in the mute state.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
PartyError GetAudioInputMuted(  
    PartyBool* muted  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
**`muted`** &nbsp; [PartyBool*](../../../typedefs.md)  
*output*  
  
True if muted, false otherwise.  
  
  
### Return value  
PartyError
  
```c_partyErrorSuccess``` if the call succeeded or an error code otherwise. The human-readable form of the error code can be retrieved via [PartyManager::GetErrorMessage()](../../PartyManager/methods/partymanager_geterrormessage.md).
  
## Remarks  
  
Muting determines whether audio data will be captured from the chat control's audio input and sent to the appropriate chat controls according to the configured relationships. When the audio input is muted, no audio data will be captured, regardless of the relationships that have been configured. Muting does not stop outgoing text messages or audio that has been generated by a call to SynthesizeTextToSpeech().
