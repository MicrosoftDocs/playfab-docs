# Xbox Live Helper library release notes

The Xbox Live Helper library is available on [Nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/PlayFab)!

## 1.0.1

#### LoginToPlayFab API

This release of the Party Xbox Live Helper library introduces the `PartyXblManager::LoginToPlayFab()` API and associated completion state change, `PartyXblLoginToPlayFabCompletedStateChange`. This API provides equivalent functionality to the PlayFab SDK `LoginWithXbox` API.
