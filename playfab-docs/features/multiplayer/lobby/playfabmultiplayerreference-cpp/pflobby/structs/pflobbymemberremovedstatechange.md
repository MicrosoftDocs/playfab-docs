# PFLobbyMemberRemovedStateChange  

Information specific to the *MemberRemoved* type of state change.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
struct PFLobbyMemberRemovedStateChange : PFLobbyStateChange {  
    PFLobbyHandle lobby;  
    PFEntityKey member;  
    PFLobbyMemberRemovedReason reason;  
}  
```
  
### Members  
  
**`lobby`** &nbsp; PFLobbyHandle  
*must not be null*  
  
The lobby the new member was removed from.
  
**`member`** &nbsp; [PFEntityKey](../../pfmultiplayer/pfentitykey_clientsdk.md)  
  
The member entity which has been removed from the lobby.
  
**`reason`** &nbsp; [PFLobbyMemberRemovedReason](../enums/pflobbymemberremovedreason.md)  
  
The reason ```member``` was removed from the lobby.
  
## Remarks  
  
This state change will be generated by all operations which remove members from lobbies such as [PFLobbyLeave()](../functions/pflobbyleave.md) and [PFLobbyForceRemoveMember()](../functions/pflobbyforceremovemember.md). <br /><br /> When this state change is provided by [PFMultiplayerStartProcessingLobbyStateChanges](../functions/pfmultiplayerstartprocessinglobbystatechanges.md) the lobby will update to remove this member from the member list and the member's properties will be emptied.
