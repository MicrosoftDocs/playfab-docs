# Multiplayer servers - detailed price sheet

PlayFab multiplayer servers operate on most generally available Azure virtual machine sizes and regions. These are the most popular series for game developers providing progressively faster processors:

- The Av2-series VMs can be deployed on a variety of hardware types and processors. The size is throttled, based upon the hardware, to offer consistent processor performance for the running instance, regardless of the hardware it is deployed on.
- The Dv3-series features the 2.4 GHz Intel XEON® E5-2673 v3** (Haswell) processor or the latest 2.3 GHz Intel XEON ® E5-2673 v4 (Broadwell) processor in a hyper-threaded configuration.
- The Fv1-series is based on the 2.4 GHz Intel XEON® E5-2673 v3 (Haswell) processor, which can achieve clock speeds as high as 3.1 GHz with the Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0. This is the same CPU performance as the Dv2-series of VMs, but F-series VMs are a better choice for workloads that demand faster CPUs, but do not need as much memory or temporary storage per CPU.

Unless otherwise specified, the price for a virtual machine is proportional to the number of virtual CPUs and their type. For example, a 4-core virtual machine from the Dv3 series will cost twice as much as a 2-core virtual machine.

> [!NOTE]
> The following prices are *per virtual machine compute hour*.
