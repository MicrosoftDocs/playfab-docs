# Real-time analytics: core concepts

The purpose of the analytics system is to give you precise insights into what is going on inside your game.

- How many players did you have today?

- Where do they struggle?
- What do they like?
- How many games were played?
- How much XP was gained?
- How many chests were opened and on which levels? 
- What is the average time for completing a certain level?

Such information is invaluable for marketing, level design, UX troubleshooting, and other aspects of your product development.

At its core, the analytics system provides tools to aggregate, query, and analyze the events generated by your game; build reports; and export and manipulate the raw data.

## PlayFab Event

An **Event**, as a data structure, represents a change in state for your game. **Events** are represented as JSON objects. Each **Event** has four parts:

1. **Name** or unique type identifier (what occurred).
2. **Entity** - such as a **Player**, **Title**, or **Character** (who's guilty).
3. **Timestamp** (when it happened).
4. **Associated Data** (a.k.a. body - what are the relevant details).

It is important to distinguish between **Automatic** and **Custom** **Events**. Our [PlayStream quickstart](../../automation/playstream-events/quickstart.md) explains the difference.

## Event Flow

The core of any analytics system is the **Event Flow**, a big list of **Events** sorted by time.

Your players produce a large number of different **Events**. Of course, **Events** are not captured by *themselves* - you need an analytics system to capture those for later analysis.

A solid analytics system allows you to group, sort, filter, count, transform, and perform calculations on a given set of **Events**, turning event flow into valuable, up-to-date information that you can use to run efficient **LiveOps**.

## Guides

- [Event history](../../automation/playstream-events/event-history.md): **Game Manager** page for inspecting the event flow inside your title.
- [Webhooks](../../analytics/metrics/webhooks.md): **Game Manager** page for automatically triggering non-PlayFab servers on specific game events.
- [S3 event archiving](../../analytics/metrics/s3-event-archiving.md): **Game Manager** page for accessing recent PlayStream events.
