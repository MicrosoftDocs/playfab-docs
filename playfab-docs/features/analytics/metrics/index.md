# Metrics

## What are metrics?

When raw data is combined to produce a meaningful measure, we refer to the result as a *metric*. Certain metrics have become standard across the game industry, because they’ve proven valuable at informing the team and guiding the decision-making process.

Some examples include:
  
- New Players  
- Monthly Active Users  
- Session Length  
- Retention  

### How PlayFab supports metrics

PlayFab’s metrics offering automatically calculates these industry-standard metrics for you on a daily basis, making them available to explore from the Reports and Trends tabs in the Analytics section. PlayFab offers views that are easy to digest, filter, and analyze.  

### Which metrics are available?

You can explore the full set of metrics available in the [Metrics and Terminology](metrics-and-terminology.md) section.
