# Game Manager

“Game Manager” is the name of our developer portal. It is your go-to destination for managing your studio and title configuration. Most of the tutorials across PlayFab will reference how to accomplish tasks both in Game Manager and through API calls. As such, this section will focus on providing guidance for initial account, studio, and title setup, as well as administrative activities. Learn how to invite teammates to collaborate with you, grant them full or partial access to make changes, configure and manage secret keys, make encryption related settings, and set how much you want to trust your client app.
