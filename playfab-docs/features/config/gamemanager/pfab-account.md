# Creating a PlayFab account

Before you can call any PlayFab API, you must have a [PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). If you already have a PlayFab account, you can skip this step.

Once you have a PlayFab account, navigate to the PlayFab home page, [https://playfab.com](https://playfab.com), and log in.

Since PlayFab does not know the name of your game studio or the title of your game, when you create a studio, a placeholder title called **My Game** is created for you. You can edit your title's information in the **Create Title** screen at any time.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Title ID** is unique to your game, which we refer to as a title. You will use this value when you make PlayFab API calls (your **Title ID** will *not* be **BCFE**).

Your first title is automatically generated by us. To create a new title, select **New title** from the Elipsis menu.

## Open the Game Manager for your title

Before installing any SDK, select a game title, and the Game Manager will open. Take the time to familiarize yourself with the various sections in the Game Manager dashboard.

For a more detailed overview, visit the [Game Manager quickstart](quickstart.md).

The PlayFab Game Manager allows you to do whatever you need to with your game title. Once you have a grasp on the aspects of the Game Manager, install the SDK so you can start using APIs. for more information on how to do this, see [Getting Started for Developers](../../../personas/developer.md).
