# Game Manager quickstart

This quickstart familiarizes you with the high-level aspects of the Game Manager. For more detailed information, you may select your specific topic of interest in the PlayFab documentation that follows.

By now, you should have created your PlayFab account, logged in, and viewed the Game Manager for your title, even if it's an empty title for now.

The sections provided below offer greater insight on each Game Manager area. Each time you perform an API call or task, view the results in the Game Manager in the appropriate area for that task.

## About the Game Manager

Now that you have an account, select a title (either the one we created or one of your own) to follow along. Within each title, the scope of a new Game Manager is distributed across the following major sections.

Game Manager is split into four major sections:
- [Title Overview]
- [Build]
- [Engage]
- [Analyze]

### Title Overview
An overview of the recent and less-recent performance of your title.

**Overview** - shows your gameâ€™s basic statistics and what you may have assigned as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In the upper-right, you will find time period toggle buttons, and there are also filters for the tables.

- **4h**: This will load data generated within the last 4 hours.  

- **24h**: This will load data generated within the last 24 hours.  

- **3d**: This will load data generated within the last 3 days.

- **7d**: This will load data generated within the last 7 days.

- **mtd**: This will load data generated within the current month.

> [!NOTE]
> In Game Manager, all times are displayed in local time.

![Game Manager - Dashboards](media/tutorials/game-manager-dashboard.png)

The tables in the Overview tab allow you to monitor PlayStream events in real time. They include the following:

- **Unique Users**: The average number of unique players logging in per day.

- **API Calls**: Indicates how many API calls were executed within the given time period.

- **CloudScript Processing Times**: Provides the average processing time for your CloudScript functions to execute.

- **LOGINS**: The number of logins recorded for the selected time span.

- **NEW USERS**: New users added in the time period.

- **PURCHASES**: The USD value of real money transactions processed for the selected time span.

- **REPORTS**: The Reports table consolidates several critical categories into a useful format. Specific Reports are also available under the **Reports** tab in Analytics.

**PlayStream Monitor** - PlayStream is our latest and greatest addition to the PlayFab platform. It displays title events as they are generated in real time, and you can visualize them at whatever granularity you prefer on the world map. Use the sampling controls to gather more or less events per second.
