# Getting Started with PlayFab

Welcome! This introductory tutorial will quickly get you up and running with **PlayFab**. Each of the following chapters contain steps to help you get started with some of the key features within **PlayFab**:

- [Chapter 1 - Getting started with Players and Tournaments](get-started-with-players-and-tournaments.md)
- [Chapter 2 - Setting up your game's in-game economy](set-up-your-games-in-game-economy.md)
- [Chapter 3 - Exploring automation](explore-automation.md)
- [Chapter 4 - Trying out Content Management](try-out-content-management.md)

If you have *already* created an account with **PlayFab**, then this tutorial has also been made available as a [special interactive version](https://developer.playfab.com/?land=help) from directly inside the **Game Manager**. If you plan on following along with these steps, then you may find that version more useful.

We also have this set of [SDK Quickstart Guides](../../../index?#pivot=documentation&panel=quickstarts), to help you make your first PlayFab API call in each of our SDK languages or environments.

Let's get started!
