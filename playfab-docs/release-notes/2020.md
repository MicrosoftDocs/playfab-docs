## 200213

Date: 2020-02-13

PlayFab's Multiplayer Servers introduces an auto scaling enhancement named Dynamic Standby that monitors standby server threshold levels and dynamically activates increased provisioning of game servers so that demand can be met at scale.  This feature adds a new object to the Multiplayer programming interface called "DynamicStandby" object. The Dynamic Standby object is an optional property of the [BuildRegionParams](/rest/api/playfab/multiplayer/multiplayer-server/update-build-regions#buildregionparams) object.

Dynamic Standby is an advanced game server feature and editing the settings from its default values should be done with caution. Configuring Dynamic Standby can be accomplished in the Game Manager Developers' portal or programmatically editing properties of the Dynamic Standby object. To learn more about Dynamic Standby, visit its user guide in the [PlayFab Multiplayer Servers](../features/multiplayer/servers/dynamic-standby.md) online documentation.

## 200128

Date: 2020-01-28

### Multiplayer Server Event Changes:

We're introducing a change to the Multiplayer Server event naming convention in efforts to unify our event names with the rest of PlayFab event names.  Additionally, we're making these changes in advance of the Multiplayer Server feature becoming Public Preview.  The changes are:

* Multiplayer Server event names will be updated to use PascalCasing
* Multiplayer Server events will no longer be sent in the legacy v1 PlayStream event format; only v2 PlayStream event format will be supported

 These two changes represent breaking changes, particularly for developers who take a dependency on non-right casing of names or PlayStream v1 of Multiplayer Server events.  These changes aren't breaking for developers who use event names in the Game Manager UI (cloud script, insights, rules, or scheduled tasks).  This change will take effect Wednesday February 26, 2020 at 10:00 AM PST.  Adjust your code for these changes before the change date.

**Format Changes**

Generally, PlayFab Events have the format similar to:

```
{
   'Event Name':'my_event'
   'Payload':
   {
      'prop1':1
      'prop2':2
      'camelcase':3
      }
}
```

The fundamental format change is that properties in the events Payload object will be updated to use PascalCasing for consistency with other PlayStream events.  Therefore, the new property names will meet the following format:

```
{
   'Event Name':'my_event'
   'Payload':
   {
      'Prop1':1
      'Prop2':2
      'CamelCase':3
      }
}
```

Observe that the property names of Multiplayer server events are now updated to use PascalCasing.

This change will impact customers who process Multiplayer server events in (a) Kusto queries or (b) PlayFab cloud scripts.  Lastly, if a customer uses the PlayFab Event Archive feature (currently in public preview), the properties of Multiplayer server events exported will also be formatted in PascalCasing.

**Schema Changes**

The second change introduced is that Multiplayer server events will only be delivered in PlayStream v2 format and no longer the legacy PlayStream v1 format.

PlayFab currently supports two event schemas.  

|Schema Format|Description|Multiplayer Events Namespace Value|
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
|PlayStream V1|Designed around player events|com.playfab.events.multiplayer|
|PlayStream V2|Designed around entity events|playfab.servers|

Generally, PlayFab APIs generate events in either PlayStream V1 format or PlayStream V2 format.  For example, APIs that grant player items generated a PlayStream V1 event.  Whereas APIs that grant entity items generated a PlayStream V2 event.  

Because the Multiplayer Servers launched in public preview at or near the same time PlayStream V2 was introduced, the Multiplayer Server feature supported both PlayStream V1 and V2 formats.  Meaning, every Multiplayer Server API call generated two events; one in V1 and V2 format.  

To remove duplication, Multiplayer server events in the 'com.playfab.events.multiplayer.servers' namespace are being deprecated.  Events in the 'playfab.servers' namespace will continue to be supported.

To distinguish between Multiplayer Server events of V1 and V2 format, examine the namespace property of the event.  The namespace is specified in the third column of the table above. The JSON representation resembles the following format:

```
{
   'FullName':
   {
      'Namespace':'abc',
      'Name':'xyz'
   }
}
```

The property to search for is named `Namespace`.
