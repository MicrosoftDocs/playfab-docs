# Cocos2D-x (C++)

>[!Important]
>This is a community supported SDK. Information on this page is no longer maintained and updated. This SDK only supports an old version of Cocos and has not been ported to support the latest version.

To learn how you can contribute and provide support for this SDK, refer to the ReadMe at [Cocos2D-x PlayFab SDK repo](https://github.com/PlayFab/Cocos2d-xSDK).

The team at Microsoft would no longer be providing official support for those using this SDK. You can continue to get community support and updates at [PlayFab forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html).

>[!Note]
>This topic provides information about the original version of the SDK and does not apply to the newer community versions.

Our Cocos2d-x SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

This SDK is auto-generated using the [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md)&mdash;an open-sourced tool developed by us. We generally build SDKs every other week in order to stay current with the latest API changes.

The Cocos SDK has not yet been fully tested across all Cocos platforms - however, this list is improving over time.

These platforms are tested, and should function very well:

- win32
- ios_mac
- android

These platforms are not tested/working yet:

- android-studio
- linux
- win8.1-universal
- win10
