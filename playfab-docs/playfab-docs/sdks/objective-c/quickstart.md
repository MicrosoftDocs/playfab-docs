# Objective-C quickstart

This quickstart assists you in making your first PlayFab API call using Objective-C, by illustrating how to get started with our [Objective-C SDK for native OSX & iOS development](https://github.com/PlayFab/Objective_C_SDK).

> [!Note]
> This SDK is currently in Beta, so please let us know if you run into any issues.

Before you can call any PlayFab API, you must have a [PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). 

Happy Developing!

## Getting started

There are two ways to get started:

1. Start with our [example implementation project](https://github.com/PlayFab/Objective_C_SDK/tree/master/Example/PFExample).
2. Import the [Objective-C SDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/Objective_C_SDK/tree/master/PlayFabSDK) into an existing XCode project.

## Configuring PlayFab

Set your PlayFab `TitleId` in PlayFabSettings.m, on the line:

```objc
  static NSString * TitleId = @"XXXX";
```

## Set up your first API call

The following code example shows you how to make a PlayFab API request, and receive the response.

```objc
//EXAMPLE: Login with custom id request:

//Build the Request object:
  ClientLoginWithCustomIDRequest* login_request = [ClientLoginWithCustomIDRequest new];
  login_request.CustomId = [[[UIDevice currentDevice] identifierForVendor] UUIDString]; //use the identifier for vendor as our custom ID.
  login_request.CreateAccount = true; //creates a new account if no existing one

//Make each call to [PlayFabClientAPI GetInstance], the first time you do this, an instance will be created and then used.
  [[PlayFabClientAPI GetInstance] LoginWithCustomID:login_request

      success:^(LoginResult* result, NSObject* userData) {
        //This block will run when we receive successful response, inspect the result class for pertinent info.
        NSLog(@"error %@",result.PlayFabId);
      }

      failure:^(PlayFabError *error, NSObject *userData) {
        //Request errored or failed to connect, inspect the PlayFabError class for pertinent info.
        NSLog(@"error %@",error.description);
      } withUserData:nil];
```

## Notes

- IDFA/advertisingIdentifier logic is present, but has not been properly tested. It is off by default, and is only available if you explicitly add **USE_IDFA=1** to **Target** > **Build Settings** > **Preprocessor Macros**.

- `testTitleData.json` is present in the project, but must be changed to valid data for any Unit Tests to work.

## Troubleshooting

For a complete list of available APIs, see our [PlayFab API References](../../api-references/index.md) documentation.
