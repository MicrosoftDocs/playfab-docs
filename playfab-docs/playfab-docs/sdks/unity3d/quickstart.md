# Quickstart: PlayFab Client library for C# in Unity

Get started with the PlayFab Client library for C# in Unity. Follow steps to install the package and try out example code for a basic task.

This quickstart helps you make your first PlayFab API call in the Unity3d engine. Before continuing, make sure you have completed [Getting started for developers](../../personas/developer.md), which ensures you have a PlayFab account and are familiar with the PlayFab Game Manager.

## Requirements

- A [PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up).
- An installed copy of the Unity Editor. To install Unity for personal use via Unity Hub, or Unity+ for professional use, see [Download Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
  > [!NOTE]
  > The PlayFab Unity3D SDK supports Unity Editor version 5.3 (released December 2015) and higher.
- A Unity Project - this can be any of the following:
  - A brand new project. For more information, see [Starting Unity for the first time](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStarted.html).
  - A guided tutorial project. For more information, see [Getting Started with Unity](https://learn.unity.com/).
  - An existing project.
- The PlayFab Unity3D SDK.

## Download and install PlayFab SDK

Use the PlayFab Editor Extensions package to install the SDK. The PlayFab Editor Extensions are a stand-alone Unity plug-in that streamlines installing the SDK and configuring the PlayFab settings for your Title. For information about installing the SDK without using the PlayFab Editor Extensions, see [Installing the PlayFab SDK for Unity](installing-unity3d-sdk.md#download-and-install-the-sdk-only).

1. Download the [PlayFab Unity Editor Extensions Asset Package](https://aka.ms/PlayFabUnityEdEx).
2. Open your Unity Project.
3. Navigate to where you downloaded the file and double-click on the `PlayFabEditorExtensions.UnityPackage` file to open the **Import Unity Package** dialog in the Unity Editor.

   ![Import Unity Asset package](media/import-uedex.png)
4. To import the PlayFab Unity Editor Extensions into your project, select **Import**.
5. When the import has completed, the PlayFab Unity Editor Extensions panel should open automatically. If you've already created a PlayFab developer account, select the **Log In** link to log in with your PlayFab username and password.

   ![Log in to PlayFab](media/extensions-login-dialog.png)
   > [!NOTE]
   > If the panel did not open, or if you close the panel and want to reopen it, you can do so by selecting **Window** > **PlayFab** > **Editor Extensions**
6. After logging in, the extension displays the SDK installation dialog.

   ![Install PlayFab SDK](media/install-sdk.png)
7. Select **Install PlayFab SDK** to automatically import the SDK into your project or upgrade the version that is currently installed.

## Set your title settings

Before you can make an API call, you must specify the Title to receive the call in the PlayFab **Title Settings**. To set the Title:

1. Select **SET MY TITLE** in the **Editor Extensions**.

    ![Set my title in the Editor Extensions](media/sdk-installation-success.png)

2. Select the **Studio** entry to open the studio drop-down menu. Select the studio that contains the Title to which you would like to connect.
3. Select the **Title ID** entry to open a drop-down menu of Titles associated with the selected studio.

The **Developer Secret Key** is automatically set to the default secret key for the Title. For more information about secret keys, see [Secret key management](../../gamemanager/secret-key-management.md).

## Making your first API call

This part of the guide provides the minimum steps to make your first PlayFab API call. This example does not provide any GUI or on-screen feedback. Confirmation is displayed in the Console log.

1. If your Unity Project doesn't already have a *Scripts* folder (**HDRP** and **LWRP/URP** templates have one by default), right-click on the **Assets** folder in the Project panel and select **Create** > **Folder**.
2. In the **Assets** window, name the folder *Scripts*.
3. Right-click the Scripts folder and select **Create** > **C# Script**.
4. Name the script PlayFabLogin.
5. Double-click the file to open it in a code-editor. Depending on your settings/installed-programs, this is likely Visual Studio or MonoDevelop.
6. In your code editor, replace the contents of PlayFabLogin.cs with the code shown below and save the file.

    ```csharp
    using PlayFab;
    using PlayFab.ClientModels;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class PlayFabLogin : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public void Start()
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(PlayFabSettings.staticSettings.TitleId)){
                /*
                Please change the titleId below to your own titleId from PlayFab Game Manager.
                If you have already set the value in the Editor Extensions, this can be skipped.
                */
                PlayFabSettings.staticSettings.TitleId = "42";
            }
            var request = new LoginWithCustomIDRequest { CustomId = "GettingStartedGuide", CreateAccount = true};
            PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithCustomID(request, OnLoginSuccess, OnLoginFailure);
        }

        private void OnLoginSuccess(LoginResult result)
        {
            Debug.Log("Congratulations, you made your first successful API call!");
        }

        private void OnLoginFailure(PlayFabError error)
        {
            Debug.LogWarning("Something went wrong with your first API call.  :(");
            Debug.LogError("Here's some debug information:");
            Debug.LogError(error.GenerateErrorReport());
        }
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The code shown above is not for use with mobile Titles. This is only an example, and shows how to log in with a `CustomID`. To implement login for a mobile Title, use either
    [LoginWithAndroidDeviceID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithandroiddeviceid), [LoginWithIOSDeviceID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithiosdeviceid), or some form of social login such as [LoginWithFacebook](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithfacebook).
7. In the **Hierarchy** panel, right-click your scene, then select **Create Empty** (or **Game Object** > **Create Empty** in older versions of Unity).
8. Select the new Game Object and in the **Inspector** panel, select **Add Component**.
9. From the component drop-down menu, select **Scripts** > **PlayFabLogin**.

For more information on creating and using scripts in the Unity Editor, see [Creating and Using Scripts](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingAndUsingScripts.html) in the Unity documentation.

## Finish and execute

You are now ready to test out this sample.

- Be sure to save all files and return to the Unity Editor
- Press the **Play** button at the top of the editor

You should see the following in your Unity Console Panel.

![Console log of first API call](media/first-call-log.png)  

> [!TIP]
>Alternatively, you can log into PlayFab and navigate to the title in Game Manager, and select the **PlayStream Monitor** tab. Each time you **Alt+ TAB** focus away from the actively running Unity Title, it passes an event which you can see and confirm in the PlayStream Monitor.

For a list of all available client API calls, see [PlayFab API References](../../api-references/index.md).
