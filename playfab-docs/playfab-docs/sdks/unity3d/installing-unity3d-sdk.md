# Installing the PlayFab SDK for Unity

You have two options when installing the PlayFab Unity 3D SDK:

- Install the PlayFab Unity Editor Extensions Asset Package. Then use Editor Extension to install the PlayFab Unity 3D SDK and configure your Unity Project.

    PlayFab Editor Extensions is a stand-alone Unity plug-in that streamlines getting started with PlayFab.

    When a supported SDK is installed, additional service menus are available. These menus provide access to SDK configurations. These configuration settings are saved in a combination of places to ensure that the data persists throughout Unity compilations and deployments. For more information about the PlayFab Editor Extensions, see the readme in the [PlayFab/UnityEditorExtensions](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnityEditorExtensions/) GitHub repo.
- Install the PlayFab Unity 3D SDK directly without using PlayFab Unity Editor Extensions. When you use this installation method, you configure your Unity Project directly by setting properties property values in your code.

This content assumes you that you have a [PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up) and an existing Unity Project.

## Install the PlayFab Unity Editor Extensions and the PlayFab SDK

1. Download the [PlayFab Unity Editor Extensions Asset Package](https://aka.ms/PlayFabUnityEdEx).
2. Open your Unity Project.
3. Navigate to where you downloaded the file and double-click on the `PlayFabEditorExtensions.UnityPackage` file to open the **Import Unity Package** dialog in the Unity Editor.

4. To import the PlayFab Unity Editor Extensions into your project, select **Import**.

   > If the panel did not open, or if you close the panel and want to reopen it, you can do so by selecting **Window** > **PlayFab** > **Editor Extensions**
6. After logging in, the extension displays the SDK installation dialog.

1. Select **SET MY TITLE** in the **Editor Extensions**.
