# JavaScript

![JavaScript](./media/javascript1.png)

Our JavaScript SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

This SDK is auto-generated using our open-sourced tool&mdash;[SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every other week to stay current with the latest API changes.

There are several methods to get this SDK. One method is to use our Content Delivery Network (CDN). For more details, seeÂ our blogpost about [JavaScript SDK via CDN](https://playfab.com/playfab-now-serving-javascript-sdk-via-cdn/).

Alternatively, you can also obtain this SDK via NPM using the command `npm install playfab-web-sdk`.
