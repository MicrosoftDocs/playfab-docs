>[!Important]
>This is a community supported SDK. Information on this page is no longer maintained and updated.

To learn how you can contribute and provide support for this SDK, refer to the ReadMe at [PHP PlayFab SDK repo](https://github.com/PlayFab/PhpSdk).

The team at Microsoft would no longer be providing official support for those using this SDK. You can continue to get community support and updates at [PlayFab forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html).

>[!Note]
>This topic provides information about the original version of the SDK and does not apply to the newer community versions.

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language, that works particularly well for server-side web development. Our PHP SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API.

For a list of prerequisites and instructions on how to set up a project using the PlayFab PHP SDK, please refer to the [PHP quickstart](quickstart.md).

This SDK is auto-generated using our open-sourced tool&mdash;[SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every other week to stay current with the latest API changes.
