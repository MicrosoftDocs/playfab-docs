>[!Important]
>The PlayFab ActionScript SDK has been deprecated. Information on this page is no longer maintained and updated. 

Adobe ended support for Adobe Flash Player and has been completely removed from common browsers. For more information, see [Adobe Flash Player End of Life General Info (external site)](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html).

Our ActionScript SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, and an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests and JSON serialization.
