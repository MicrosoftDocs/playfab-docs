# PlayFab Release Notes 2017

## 171204  

Date: 2017-12-04

### Unreal SDK changes (Cpp and Bp)

- Updated both SDKs to **Unreal 4.18.1**.
- Older versions will still work, but require un-commenting `#defines` in the \_.build.cs files.

## 171127  

Date: 2017-11-27

### API changes

- An inventory feature allowing "Limited Edition" items is now released from beta.

- This lets you define that only a fixed number of a particular `itemId` will be available in your game.
- A virtual currency property has been removed from API methods that use "[ProfileModel](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile#playerprofilemodel)", as that information was never actually provided or correct. It will return... someday.

### New API methods

- admin.[CheckLimitedEditionItemAvailability](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.playeritemmanagement.checklimitededitionitemavailability)
- admin.[IncrementLimitedEditionItemAvailability](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.playeritemmanagement.incrementlimitededitionitemavailability)
- client.[GetPaymentToken](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playeritemmanagement.getpaymenttoken)
  - Used for [XSolla specific payment processing](../features/commerce/economy/non-receipt-payment-processing.md)
- client.[ReportDeviceInfo](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.analytics.reportdeviceinfo)
  - This API method is not meant to be called directly. It is currently a built-in feature for Unity and Lumberyard SDKs. It can be disabled with the [API Policy](../api-references/api-access-policy.md). Additionally, we will be adding another option soon to disable in the title settings page in Game Manager.

### Updated API method error codes

- client.[AddOrUpdateContactEmail](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.addorupdatecontactemail)
- client.[GetLeaderboardAroundPlayer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.getleaderboardaroundplayer)
- client.[LoginWithAndroidDeviceID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithandroiddeviceid)
- client.[LoginWithCustomID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithcustomid)
- client.[LoginWithIOSDeviceID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithiosdeviceid)

### SDK specific updates

- [UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK): We are now building all published unity package files with Unity 2017.2.0f3.
- For testing, we internally updated to the latest for each major.minor version, from Unity 4.7.2f1 to 2017.1.2f1.
- Unity Example Test Game Server: Fix applied to `HttpHelper` to fix SSL validation on `SignalR` requests.
- [ActionScriptSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/ActionScriptSDK): AirSdk in example updated to v27.
- [Cocos2d-xSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/Cocos2d-xSDK): We are still targeting 3.15.1, despite 3.16 Cocos release (stay tuned).
- SdkTestingCloudScript and [NodeSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/NodeSDK): Updated the example VS projects to support VS/msbuild 2017.
- WindowsSDK: This will be the last build of the nuget package targeting Visual Studio 2013:
  - [WindowsSdk VS 2013 Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/com.playfab.windowssdk.v120/1.19.171127)
  - We are updating our automated build machines, and we won't be installing VS 2013 on the new ones.
  - The [newer nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/com.playfab.windowssdk.v140/) will continue to work on VS 2015 and 2017.

## 171106

- [player_updated_contact_email](../api-references/events/player-updated-contact-email.md)
- [sent_email](../api-references/events/sent-email.md)

### Unreal specific update

- Our auto builder failed to publish the Unreal SDKs for build number 171016 and 171026. The issue with our auto-builder has been resolved, and version 171026 has been published after the fact, and releases will resume normally

### Unity specific changes

- **MINOR BREAKING CHANGE:** `ForgetClientCredentials` has been renamed to `ForgetAllCredentials`.
- This is part of a new feature that will be coming soon. `ForgetClientCredentials` will be renamed to `ForgetAllCredentials` in all SDKs over the next few releases.

## 171026  

Date: 2017-10-26

### API documentation changes

- Updating error codes for API methods.

- Many error codes that are universal to all API methods have been removed from the per-API-method list. A new page will be made which describes universal error codes.
- **Removed Universal Codes:**
  - InvalidParams
  - OverLimit
  - DataUpdateRateExceeded
  - AccountBanned
- These errors (and others, to be published in a separate document), can be returned from any API method and should be handled appropriately.
- New error codes have been added to several dozen API methods, and a few false codes removed. The error code lists should be much more accurate for method-specific error returns. This is still an ongoing process, so there will be more updates.
- Several API methods involving virtual currency can decrease the balance below zero. These have been labeled appropriately.

### API changes

- **New API methods:**
  - admin.[DeleteTitle](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.accountmanagement.deletetitle)
  - Hosted game servers support both **IPv4** and **IPv6**.
  - Custom game servers now support **IPV6**. All newly started game server instances are assigned both **IPV4** and **IPV6** addresses, which are displayed in the Game Manager **Servers** tab and returned by the matchmaking APIs. Clients can connect to either the **IPV4** or **IPV6** address for the assigned server.
  - All API methods that return server addresses now return both options: client.[StartGame](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.matchmaking<!-- .startgame -->).[StartGameResult](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.matchmaking<!-- .startgame#startgameresult -->)

### Game Manager changes

- You can now delete titles using the new Admin/DeleteTitle API, or on the Game Manager studios page, as shown below.
   ![DelTitleGameManager](images/171026-DelTitleGameManager.png)

## 171016  

Date: 2017-10-16

### API changes

- Added a parameter to server.[SendPushNotification](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification).[SendPushNotificationRequest](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification#sendpushnotificationrequest).[PushNotificationPackage](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification#pushnotificationpackage), for iOS Badge.
- Clarified the device-specific nature of various parameters.

### New PlayStream events

- [player_started_purchase](../api-references/events/player-started-purchase.md)
- [player_paid_for_purchase](../api-references/events/player-paid-for-purchase.md)

### JavaScriptSDK specific changes

- [JavaScriptSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/JavaScriptSDK)
  - Our SDK now integrates with [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/).
  - Read our tutorial [Setting up PlayFab authentication in Phaser.io](../features/authentication/platform-specific-authentication/phaser-io.md)!

### LuaSDK specific changes

- [LuaSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/LuaSDK)
  - Our Lua publish pipeline has been fixed, and LuaSDK is being updated properly again.

### UnitySdk specific changes

- [UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - A [regression in Unity](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unitywebrequest-getresponseheaders-method-returns-null-on-android-devices) has been handled on our side, and should no longer affect PlayFab customers.

~~**UnrealCppSdk specific changes:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

- ~~One of our customers has made an add-on plugin to our SDK which integrates the Unreal OnlineSubsystem & the PlayFab SDK~~
- ~~You can check it out [here](https://gitlab.com/mtuska/OnlineSubsystemPlayFab).~~

### Unicorn Battle example

- Deleted PlayFab custom Push Plugin & Updated to FCM push messages.

## 170925  

Date: 2017-09-05

### API Changes

- A handful of beta APIs that were never made public have been removed. This should not affect any current customers or live titles.
- We bypassed the default language-level header checks in our CloudScript engine. This means several CloudScript http.request() headers that were formerly being rejected should now work.

### Global Push Notification update

- Please see [our blog](https://blog.playfab.com/blog/push-sep-17) for details about the improvements to Push Notifications

### New PlayStream events

- [player_device_info](../api-references/events/player-device-info.md)
- Games using the latest UnitySDK can now see some basic analytics data about their customers. SnowFlake is ideal for viewing and analyzing this information, but it's also available in the PlayStream Event History.
- player_updated_membership

### JavaScriptSDK specific changes

- [JavaScriptSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/JavaScriptSDK)
  - A handful of mini-features that exist in other SDKs have been added to JavaScriptSDK:
  - You can now inject extra headers into requests (removing one of the blockers for Double Encrypted Logins with this SDK).
  - Added a new function: `PlayFabClientSDK.ForgetClientCredentials()`
  - This is a convenience function that allows you to reset the client after shutting down or logging out.
  - `PlayFab.GenerateErrorReport()`
  - This is a convenience function that converts the error-result from a failed PlayFab call into a single complete description of how the call failed.
- Added optional data relays into the PlayFab API requests:
  - `result.customData`
    - This is any contextual object you can attach to the request, which can provide context for the result. For example, you can provide a local client-player object as the `customData` for an **UpdatePlayerStatistics** call, and set the updated statistics on that player after the remote call has succeeded.
  - `result.request`
    - The request for your API calls are now relayed to the result, which can provide context for the result. For example, when you call `UpdatePlayerStatistics`, you can read the updated stats from the request, when updating your local player object.

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - New experimental feature: This release of PlayFab UnitySDK now optionally allows you to see device information for your players. Example information you can see is: memory, resolution, user-agent, device-type, OS version, etc.

~~**UnrealCppSdk specific changes:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

- ~~Updated to Unreal 4.17~~
- ~~Split apart into 3 separate plugins, each with different functionality~~
- ~~Pretty significant upgrades overall~~

## 170828  

Date: 2017-08-28

### Client API changes

- client.[GetCurrentGames](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.matchmaking.getcurrentgames).[result](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.matchmaking.getcurrentgames#currentgamesresult).Games[i].GameServerState has been deprecated, and replaced with [GameServerStateEnum](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.matchmaking.getcurrentgames#gameinstancestate).
- GameServerState was serialized as an integer, which was an error. The new field is a proper enum-string.

### Other API changes

- The following API methods have been deprecated on Admin and Server APIs.
  - [GetActionsOnPlayersInSegmentTaskInstance](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.scheduledtask.getactionsonplayersinsegmenttaskinstance) - This has accidentally been labeled as deprecated, but that was an error which will be reverted.
- [SendPushNotification](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification) can now specify [TargetPlatforms](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification#sendpushnotificationrequest)
- Added some clarifications for which parameters work on which platforms for [SendPushNotificationRequest](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification#sendpushnotificationrequest) (Using parameters not supported for a target platform is not recommended).
- Added some info about [Shared Group](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.sharedgroupdata.createsharedgroup) [restrictions](../features/social/groups/using-shared-group-data.md) to the Shared Group documentation (specifically that they can't be used for anything like Guilds).
- [Player Profiles](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile#playerprofilemodel) can now store a player [contact email address](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile#contactemailinfomodel).

### New PlayStream events

- [entity_created](../api-references/events/entity-created.md)
- [entity_logged_in](../api-references/events/entity-logged-in.md)

## 170814  

Date: 2017-08-14

### API updates

- server.[GetFriendsList](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.friendlistmanagement.getfriendslist) and client.[GetFriendsList](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.friendlistmanagement.getfriendslist) API methods now return a [PlayerProfile](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.friendlistmanagement.getfriendslist#playerprofilemodel) for each of your friends.

### CSharpSdk specific updates

- SDK now includes a file called [NewtonSoftJsonWrapper.cs](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK/blob/master/PlayFabSDK/source/Json/NewtonsoftWrapper.cs) which will let you swap out our included SimpleJson serializer with the NewtonSoft nuget package.
- The file includes instructions on how to use it.

## 170807  

Date: 2017-08-07

### New API methods

- admin.[DeletePlayer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.accountmanagement.deleteplayer)

### Deprecated API methods

- These API methods never worked as fully and completely as they were supposed to. In an effort to clean this up, we've started over, and built the new [DeletePlayer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.accountmanagement.deleteplayer) API above, and these are deprecated:
- `admin.ResetUsers`
- `admin.DeleteUsers`

### API updates

- `PlayerProfile` (in [Admin](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile#playerprofilemodel)/[Server](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile#playerprofilemodel)/[PlayStream](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile#playerprofilemodel)) contains a new field `ContactEmailAddresses`, which contains any email address info you may have saved about your players.

### PlayStream events

- New Event: [auth_token_validated](../api-references/events/auth-token-validated.md)
- New Event: [player_removed_title](../api-references/events/player-removed-title.md)

- New Field in Event: [player_realmoney_purchase](../api-references/events/player-realmoney-purchase.md).TransactionId

~~**LumberyardSdk changes:**~~

- ~~**UPGRADE WARNING:** This SDK is no longer compatible with previous versions of Lumberyard.~~
- ~~This release of PlayFab LumberyardSdk no longer works with Lumberyard version 1.3. It has been upgraded and now targets Lumberyard 1.9. We will very likely have it targeting 1.10 in the near future, but again without backwards compatibility to 1.9 or earlier. See [our blog](https://blog.playfab.com/blog/cpp-sdk-updates) for details.~~

~~**UnrealCppSdk:**~~ (**UPDATED**: This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk)).

<!-- ~~This SDK has been discontinued, and will no longer be maintained. We will produce an upgrade guide so that users can switch to the UnrealBlueprintSdk. Please see this blog for more details.~~
- ~~See our [upgrade guide](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnrealBlueprintSDK/blob/master/UnrealCppSdkUpgradeGuide.md)~~-->

~~**Unreal SDK:**~~ (**UPDATED**: This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

- ~~The PlayFab UnrealBlueprintSdk is now rebranded as the "Unreal SDK"~~
- ~~Unreal SDK has been updated to 4.16, with some minor fixes~~
- ~~We're also removing support for older versions of Unreal, which require older versions of Visual Studio~~
- ~~We now support 4.14 thru 4.16~~
- ~~Your project may continue working for older versions of Visual Studio, but we can only support and test Visual Studio 2015 and later~~
- ~~Read [our blog](https://blog.playfab.com/blog/visual-studio-2013-deprecation-notice) for more info~~

### Unity Editor Extensions

- Fixed issues downloading and uploading CloudScript revisions.
- Fixed issues for users whose system language uses non-ASCII letters.

## 170710  

Date: 2017-07-10

### API changes

- An Enterprise feature for double-encrypted logins has been released from beta, and is now live.
- **New API methods:**
  - admin.[CreatePlayerSharedSecret](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.createplayersharedsecret)
  - admin.[DeletePlayerSharedSecret](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.deleteplayersharedsecret)
  - admin.[GetPlayerSharedSecrets](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.getplayersharedsecrets)
  - admin.[SetPlayerSecret](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.setplayersecret)
  - admin.[UpdatePlayerSharedSecret](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.updateplayersharedsecret)
  - client.[GetTitlePublicKey](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.gettitlepublickey)
  - client.[SetPlayerSecret](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.setplayersecret)
  - server.[SetPlayerSecret](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.authentication.setplayersecret)
- server.[RegisterGameRequest](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.matchmaking<!-- .registergame#registergamerequest -->) has a new property: LobbyId, which will let you attempt to re-register an existing game
- server.[SendPushNotificationRequest](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.sendpushnotification#sendpushnotificationrequest) now accepts a new property: Package, which defines all of the advanced Android push capabilities.

### SDK breaking change

- admin.[SetupPushNotificationRequest](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.title-widedatamanagement.setuppushnotification#setuppushnotificationrequest).Platform is now defined as an enum instead of a string. This is not a breaking change to the API (as enums are transmitted as strings), but it will require some users to convert their strings to the enum values in their code.

### Changes in all SDKs

- Minor SDK Breaking Change: Most SDKs have lost an optional field in multiple requests called UseSpecificVersion, which was an alternate way to define the adjacent Version field as null. Not all languages have the capability to define an integer as null in the request, and this field was only meant to be useful in relevant SDKs (Specifically Unreal). If you are using this field, just remove it, and set the adjacent Version field to null when appropriate.

### Unity EditorExtensions update

- The flags panel has been updated.
- `ENABLE/DISABLE_IDFA` flag can be toggled now.
- Displays non-PlayFab flags, and allows you to remove them (use with caution, don't remove flags you need).

### SDK Dependency updates

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK) built, packaged, and tested with Unity2017.1.0f1.
  - Only trivial, non-breaking changes.
- [ActionScriptSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/ActionScriptSDK) tested with AirSDK v26.
  - SDK unchanged, example updated to target v26.
- [Cocos2d-xSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/Cocos2d-xSDK) built, and tested with Cocos 3.15.1.
- Cocos 3.14->3.15 contained changes that broke our example, which in turn meant the example had to be updated. The example still works with 3.13 thru 3.15, but the example probably won't work with older versions of Cocos SDK unchanged, and should continue to work with most of the latest 3.X Cocos versions.

## 170612  

Date: 2017-06-12

### Documentation changes

- Many small revisions to dozens of API methods for clarity
- Several documentation-groupings, each which only contained a single API method, have been merged into a single group called "Platform Specific Methods".
- The "Matchmaking  APIs" group has been renamed to "Matchmaking" to be consistent with other groups.
- Many length-restricted string fields now describe the allowed ranges.

### Changes in all SDKs

- Lots of broken links in all SDK readme's have been updated and fixed.

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - We now support multiple versions of the Android API and Google Play Services. Read more details [here](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK/tree/master/Packages).
  - This concludes the planned changes to the Unity + Android Push-Plugin for now. Please let us know if you have any additional requests [here](https://community.playfab.com/questions/10840/android-plugin-upgrade-discussion.html).

## 170530  

Date: 2017-05-30

### API changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** In server.[ReportPlayer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement.reportplayer), the `titleId` field in  [ReportPlayerServerRequest](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement.reportplayer#reportplayerserverrequest) has been immediately removed (not merely deprecated). All reports will now go to their own title, and cannot report to another title.
  - This had to be a breaking change as it was otherwise a mild cross-title exploit. [Contact us](https://community.playfab.com/questions/ask.html) if you need assistance with this change.
- In client.[ReportPlayer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.reportplayer) and server.[ReportPlayer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement.reportplayer), result.Updated has been deprecated in both cases. It was always true, and the API Call would always return an error if the player was over the report limit. This error condition has been updated to be OverLimit to match other limits.
- All [login methods](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication) can now return a [player profile object](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithandroiddeviceid#playerprofilemodel), if requested, which contains information previously only available to leaderboard results.

### New API methods

- client.[GetPlayerProfile](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile) and server.[GetPlayerProfile](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile)
  - Returns information previously only available to leaderboard results.

### Documentation

- Small updates, several examples no longer contain information about deprecated fields.
- [ExecuteCloudScript](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.server-sidecloudscript.executecloudscript) return and log size limits defined.

### New PlayStream events

- [gameserverhost_started](../api-references/events/gameserverhost-started.md)
- [gameserverhost_stopped](../api-references/events/gameserverhost-stopped.md)
- [player_set_profile_property](../api-references/events/player-set-profile-property.md)

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - Our Android Push plugin has been overhauled.
  - [Blog Post](https://blog.playfab.com/blog/push-upgrade-5-22)
  - [New/Updated Guide](../features/engagement/push-notifications/push-notifications-for-android.md)

### CSharpSDK specific changes

- [CSharpSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK)
  - It is now possible to specify extra headers that will be injected into an API request.
  - This is an Enterprise-Only feature, specifically for double-encrypted login requests.

## 170508  

Date: 2017-05-08

### API changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE:**
  - [ExecuteCloudScript](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.server-sidecloudscript.executecloudscript) will not serialize the return value of your call, if it is too large.
  - [ExecuteCloudScript](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.server-sidecloudscript.executecloudscript) will not serialize the logs for your call, if they are too large.
- Under either of these conditions, the call will still return 200/successful, but the FunctionResult and/or Logs properties will be null.

### PlayStream event changes

- [player_vc_item_purchased](../api-references/events/player-vc-item-purchased.md) and [character_vc_item_purchased](../api-references/events/character-vc-item-purchased.md) now contain a StoreId parameter indicating which store was used to make a purchase.
- **New event:**
  - [title_profile_view_constraints_changed](../api-references/events/title-profile-view-constraints-changed.md)

### CSharpSDK updates

- [CSharpSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK)
  - Some unused source files in [CSharpSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK) have been deleted.
  - This should not affect any existing projects, or the Nuget package, as those files were not referenced by the Visual Studio Solution.

### Postman collection update

- Several common request parameters now utilize environment variables.
- Specifically, TitleId={{TitleId}}, PlayFabId={{PlayFabId}}, CharacterId={{CharacterId}}, and CatalogVersion={{PrimaryCatalogName}}

## 170424  

Date: 2017-04-24

### SDK hotfix release

- **[JavaSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/JavaSDK) Updates:**
  - We now publish Jar files for the SDK, one for code, and one for Java docs, which you can import into your Java project instead of copy-pasting code. Thanks to Will Iverson <!--(https://gamestudioone.com/)--> for helping us improve our [JavaSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/JavaSDK) usability
- **UnityEditorExtensions updates:**
  - We have resolved some install-time exceptions. Specifically it is no longer required that you restart Unity after a first-time install.
  - Additionally, an issue where the Client API was sometimes disabled inappropriately is now fixed. (edited)
- ~~**UnrealCppSdk Updates:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))
- ~~The titleId is now available from the Plugin interface~~

## 170411  

Date: 2017-04-11

### API changes

- New Enterprise Feature: Additional login encryption
- You can utilize the Policy API methods to enforce Login Calls can require a second layer of encryption
- See: [UpdatePolicy](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.updatepolicy) , specifically [UpdatePolicyRequest](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.updatepolicy#updatepolicyrequest).[Statements](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.updatepolicy#permissionstatement).[ApiConditions](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.updatepolicy#apicondition)

### API changes

- **Client & Server Leaderboard Methods:** Get-Leaderboard methods (such as client.[GetLeaderboard](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.getleaderboard)) previously gained new non-nullable parameters Version and UseSpecificVersion. The requirement that they were non-nullable was an API-breaking change. We have updated these properties to be fully optional.
- **Client API:** The Items field of [GetPurchaseResult](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playeritemmanagement.getpurchase#getpurchaseresult) will be deprecated: This portion of the result is often incorrect or incomplete. It will eventually be replaced with a fully functional parameter.

### New PlayStream events

- `player_display_name_filtered`

~~**Unreal Specific Changes:**~~ (**UPDATED** : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new Unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

- ~~UnrealCppSdk: An issue where PlayFab settings such as TitleId were lost when publishing a build has been fixed.
Both SDKs have been tested and verified working with Unreal 4.15~~

  - Dependencies are now Maven controlled and no longer included with the SDK.
  - Our internal automated testing has been converted to Maven command line.

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - Internal Unity version for testing and building asset bundles updated to 5.6.0. Our Unity SDK remains compatible with all versions of Unity from 4.7 thru 5.6.

- PlayFab can now authenticate clients using Windows Hello and validate Windows store receipts

### New APIs

This may result in some broken connections for your project when you upgrade. (File names and file contents have not changed. New **TypeScript** files now exist, which did not exist before.)

### API changes

- Added clarifying documentation to CDN APIs. Specifically mentioning that the CDN is not part of our free service.
- Google login fixes (Blog Post Pending).

### New PlayStream events

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - Fixed an issue where where **JsonWrapper** did not work as expected in all cases.
  - See our forum post for details: <https://community.playfab.com/questions/7599/cloudscript-getplayercombinedinfo-little-problem.html>
  - All of the following deprecated wrapper classes have been removed in favor of `PlayFab.Json.JsonWrapper`:
    - `PlayFab.Json.JsonConvert` (Use `PlayFab.Json.JsonWrapper`)
    - `PlayFab.Json.SimpleJson` (Use `PlayFab.Json.JsonWrapper` or `PlayFab.Json.PlayFabSimpleJson`)
    - `PlayFab.SimpleJson` (Use `PlayFab.Json.JsonWrapper` or `PlayFab.Json.PlayFabSimpleJson`)
  - Repeating a note from [160627](2016.md#160627), `UnityEngine.SimpleJson` is an empty namespace in the `UnityEngine.dll`, and that makes it necessary for us to not use that identifier.

### Unity Editor Extensions

- Resolved an issue where the PlayFab panel will re-load infinitely if your account cannot view any studios.
- Resolved an issue where `PlayFabSharedSettings` (Scriptable Object) would sometimes not save properly if you picked your title from the PlayFab panel.

### SDKGenerator specific changes

- [SDKGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator)
