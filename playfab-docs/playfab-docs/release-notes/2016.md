## 161108  

Date: 2016-11-07

### HOTFIX

Version 1.0 of the overhauled [CSharpSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK) increased the .Net version requirement from 4.0 to 4.6. This was not intended. This hotfix removes the 4.6 only features, so that it will once again build on .Net 4.0 or higher.

## 161107  

Date: 2016-11-06

### API changes

**Shared**

- `CatalogItem`
- `InitialLimitedEditionCount` ( out of beta )
If `IsLImitedEdition` is `true`, then this determines amount of the item initially available. Note that this field is ignored if the catalog item already existed in this catalog, or the field is less than 1.
- Player display name uniqueness is now optional.
- Player display name returned as Photon "Nickname" when players connect to Photon Cloud.

**Server API**

- `RedeemCouponRequest`
  - Added: `CharacterId`
  - Optional identifier for the Character that should receive the item. If `null`, item is added to the player.
- **UpdatePlayerStatisticsRequest**
  - Added: `ForceUpdate`
    - Indicates whether the statistics provided should be set, regardless of the aggregation method set on the statistic. Default is `false`.

### New PlayStream events

- `Player_photon_session_authenticated`
- `Title_secret_key_changed`
- `Title_api_settings_changed`

### SDK changes

- [CSharpSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK) Specific Changes:
  - [Major CSharp upgrade](https://blog.playfab.com/blog/csharpsdk-upgrade/)

## 161031  

Date: 2016-10-30

~~**Unreal Blueprints hotfix release**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

- ~~UnrealBlueprintSDK **upgrade warning**: There was a naming conflict between Android and the PlayFab "SourceType" enum. As a result, we've had to rename this blueprint-enum. This breaks any [Client/GetStoreItems](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.title-widedatamanagement.getstoreitems) or [Admin/GetStoreItems](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.title-widedatamanagement.getstoreitems) PlayFab-api-nodes. The upgrade process in-editor is to delete and re-create each affected blueprint node.~~

- ~~UnrealBlueprintSDK Specific Changes:~~
  - ~~Fixed a minor bug where certain errors would not report correctly~~
  - ~~Fixed a name conflict that prevented making Android builds (ESourceType)~~

## 161017  

Date: 2016-10-16

### Deprecation changes

- `Client/GetUserCombinedInfo` has transitioned from `Proposed` to `Deprecated`, which means most SDKs using this will now throw an error. Please transition to [Client/GetPlayerCombinedInfo](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayercombinedinfo).
- Deprecated APIs from this patch note: [160822](#160822) have transitioned from deprecated to obsolete, according to this blog: [Deprecation Visibility](https://playfab.com/blog/deprecation-visibility/) and thus, those APIs have been removed from the newest version of the SDKs. If you update your SDK, you must now transition to the new replacement APIs.
- `Password` in the `Admin UserCredentials` object has been deprecated. You no longer need to know your user's password to call the `Admin/ResetUsers` method.

### UnitySdk breaking changes

- [UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - If you are using reflection on PlayFab API-model types, you will have to convert your reflection logic from properties to fields (See UnitySdk Specific Changes below).

### API changes

- **New PlayStream events:**
  - [gamelobby_started](../api-references/events/gamelobby-started.md)
  - [gamelobby_ended](../api-references/events/gamelobby-ended.md)
  - [Client/AttributeInstall](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.advertising.attributeinstall) request has deprecated `Android_Id` and converted to `Adid`. All SDKs have had some internal login hooks updated to account for this. This is not a breaking change, because it was always intended to use Google-AdvertisingId (Adid), and using the Android DeviceId here would not have worked properly. This change is merely for clarity and consistency
  - For the GitHub add-on, revisions to CloudScript will no longer immediately go live. Instead a new revision will be made, and you make it live via Game Manager
  - The default `helloWorld` CloudScript function described in this doc: [CloudScript quickstart](../features/automation/cloudscript/quickstart.md) was out of date. Updated the document to more closely match the current version (This is only relevant to new title creation)

### API Server bug fixes

- Fixed a 500 error in [Server/ExecuteCloudScript](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.server-sidecloudscript.executecloudscript): PlayFabId is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)
- Fixed a 500 error in [Server/GetSharedGroupData](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.sharedgroupdata.getsharedgroupdata): SharedGroupId is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)
- Fixed a 500 error in [Server/AddSharedGroupMembers](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.sharedgroupdata.addsharedgroupmembers): PlayFabIds is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)
- Fixed a 500 error in [Server/RemoveSharedGroupMembers](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.sharedgroupdata.removesharedgroupmembers): PlayFabIds is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)
- Fixed a 500 error in [Server/DeleteSharedGroup](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.sharedgroupdata.deletesharedgroup): SharedGroupId is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)

### LuaSDK specific changes

- [LuaSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/LuaSDK)
  - Better identification headers for Corona vs Defold.

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - Model properties have been converted to fields so they display better in the Unity Inspector (where relevant).
  - Fixed a bug where if a CloudScript function returns a primitive, it will now be properly deserialized and returned as FunctionResult (Formerly it would have been null).
  - The PaperTrail package has been fixed: [UnityPlayFabPaperTrail.unitypackage](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK/blob/master/Packages/UnityPlayFabPaperTrail.unitypackage)

### SDKGenerator specific changes

- [SDKGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator)
  - [SDKGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator) can additionally read `Api-Specs` from Api-Server or GitHub, allowing customers to build their custom SDKs in-sync with PlayFab api-server, and with fewer steps and dependencies.

## 160912

Date: 2016-09-11

### Unity and CSharp upgrade warning

- The deprecation warnings described [below](#160822) have gone into effect. Deprecated APIs will now throw compiler errors when possible.
Likewise, the documentation for those APIs have been filtered from the main documentation.

### API changes

- **New APIs**
  - `Admin/GetAllActionGroups`
  - `Server/GetAllActionGroups`

### LuaSDK specific changes

- [LuaSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/LuaSDK)
  - Incremental Corona Support: There are new/interim zip-files which can be included in a Corona project. Proper Corona plugins are coming soon.

## 160829  

Date: 2016-08-28

### API changes

- **New APIs**
  - [Client/GetPlayerTags](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playstream.getplayertags)
  - [Server/AddPlayerTag](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playstream.addplayertag)
  - [Server/GetPlayerTags](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playstream.getplayertags)
  - [Server/RemovePlayerTag](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playstream.removeplayertag)
  - [Admin/AddPlayerTag](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.playstream.addplayertag)
  - [Admin/GetPlayerTags](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.playstream.getplayertags)
  - [Admin/RemovePlayerTag](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.playstream.removeplayertag)
  
We have introduced segment tags, which provide a way of directly putting players into particular segments. You can now add one or more segment tags to each player. And then, when creating a segment, you can define the segment based on the segment tag.

One intended use for Segment Tags is for integration with external analytics providers, like Appuri. The external analytics provider can perform its own advanced segmentation, such as "Likely to Churn", and then set a tag on players that match that segment.
All current deprecation changes have been released. Please see our blog post for details: <https://playfab.com/deprecation-visibility/>

### Cocos2d-xSDK specific changes

- [Cocos2d-xSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/Cocos2d-xSDK)
  - Special thanks to Max Muthig from Forest Ring Games for the following update:
    - Added support for lambda callback functions (formerly only static functions were allowed).

### PostmanCollection specific changes

- [PostmanCollection](https://github.com/PlayFab/PostmanCollection)
  - Added a header to all API methods which will help our servers track SDK usage. (This header already exists on all other SDKs).

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)

  - We are pleased to announce the initial public beta release of our latest tool: Unity Editor Extensions. This plugin provides an easy-to-use interface for configuring and managing the PlayFab SDK. All Unity developers are encouraged to check out EdEx; There has never been an easier time to sign up and get started developing.
  - Added an alternate implementation of `ExecuteCloudScript` which automatically parses `FunctionResult` into a target type, using a generic parameter.
  - Failure cases in API methods are improved: Some cases that threw exceptions now properly report back to the error-callback (such as Web-Requests with no internet connection), and other cases report better information to the error-callback.

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk specific changes:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

- ~~Fixed an issue where APIs containing an optional list field in the request would not post the request properly to the server. (Such as GetPlayerStatistics)~~

### SDKGenerator specific changes

- [SDKGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator)
  - Updated documentation, and an example project to better document for PlayFab users how to create their own SDKs for our API.

## 160822

  - The easiest fix is to upgrade your Unity3D version, but we will try to restore this in a later release of our SDK.

## 160725  

Date: 2016-07-24

### API changes

- **New PlayStream Event**

  - Some API examples have been updated.
  - Lots of minor documentation updates.

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - Introduced a `PlayFabRequestCommon base-class`, which does compile-time type-checking for request objects passed to the API (This should not affect any users unless they're using non-standard request objects).

  - Fixed a null-reference bug in startup that some users have reported.
  - Fixed an issue with `ProductionEnvironmentUrl` in the `PlayFabSharedSettings` `ScriptableObject` that some users have reported.

## 160721  

Date: 2016-07-20

### UnitySDK hotfix changes

  - A bunch of small high-visibility fixes that have been noticed by many in the community have been fixed.
  - UnitySDK V2 was promised to have full Windows Phone/Universal support (as well as other platforms like consoles). We're happy to say that all known issues have finally been fixed for all known platforms, and the PlayFab UnitySdk should work everywhere.

  - Due to an unexpected side-effect in Unity, we won't be able to apply the `HideAndDontSave` flag to the PlayFab Http Object. [Details Here](https://answers.unity.com/questions/1218422/hideanddontsave-disables-ondestroy.html).
  - We have added a set of extension functions to reflection, which make both standard C# and .NetCore C# do the same thing with the same lines of code, when possible. This extension it is not meant to be a complete solution for all possible reflection inconsistencies between those platforms.

## 160714  

Date: 2016-07-13

- A `JsonProperty` attribute has been added to `SimpleJson` and supports alternate naming of fields/properties, and omitting nulls from the serialized json.
- TimeSpans serialized with the default PlayFab `SimpleJson` strategy will now serialize as a float number of seconds. Formerly, they would serialize as structs which wasn't supported by the API or any cross-platform options.
- Support for certain platforms (EG: consoles, iOS) that build using Mono2x mode will not be supported until <https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK/blob/master/V2UPGRADE.md> goes live.
- Support for Windows Universal will not be supported until <https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK/blob/master/V2UPGRADE.md> goes live.
- See this blog post for more details: <https://blog.playfab.com/blog/new-and-improved-unity-sdk-beta-preview>
(standalone and android work correctly and are supported for all options)
- All platforms that can utilize IL2CPP are supported in that mode.
- This version was initially launched with an issue where compression did not always work. It was hot-fixed on July-8. Initial downloads before this date may have compression issues, which can be solved by updating, or by disabling compression: (PlayFabSettings.CompressApiData = false;)

### UnitySDK upgrade warning

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - `PlayFab.Internal.Util` has been renamed to `PlayFab.Internal.PlayFabUtil`. The "Util" name is very common and exists in the root level for many projects, which causes name conflicts for those customers.

  - When updating PlayFab-UnitySdk, you may see some deprecation warnings if you are using PlayFab's implementation of SimpleJson. Please resolve these at your leisure.

### API changes

- **New Admin APIs**

  - [GetTitleInternalData](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.title-widedatamanagement.gettitleinternaldata)
  - [SetTitleInternalData](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.title-widedatamanagement.settitleinternaldata)

- **New PlayStream events**

  - [character_consumed_item](../api-references/events/character-consumed-item.md)
  - [character_created](../api-references/events/character-created.md)
  - [character_inventory_item_added](../api-references/events/character-inventory-item-added.md)
  - [character_statistic_changed](../api-references/events/character-statistic-changed.md)
  - [character_vc_item_purchased](../api-references/events/character-vc-item-purchased.md)
  - [character_virtual_currency_balance_changed](../api-references/events/character-virtual-currency-balance-changed.md)
  - [player_redeemed_coupon](../api-references/events/player-redeemed-coupon.md)

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - Known issues: Windows Store apps, and non-IL2CPP build options do not work yet. Stay tuned for a blog post about these issues and our new repository: UnitySDKV2Beta [UPDATE: Old link removed].
  - We discovered a name-conflict with the core `UnityEngine` DLL, specifically an empty namespace called ``SimpleJson``. As such, we've had to rename and reorganize our JSON classes... again. Many apologies.

### Global SDK upgrade warning

- PlayFabSettings and PlayFabVersion: These files and their contents have been merged into PlayFabSettings.
- If you were previously referencing the PlayFabVersion variables, update to the same/very-similar variable in PlayFabSettings.

### API changes

- **New API**

  - [SetGameServerInstanceData](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.matchmaking.setgameserverinstancedata)
- **Bug fix for APIs:**
  - [Server/SetGameServerInstanceState](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.matchmaking.setgameserverinstancestate)
  - [Client/GetCurrentGames](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.matchmaking.getcurrentgames)

### SDK global changes

- Please note that `RunCloudScript` has been deprecated since March 2016, and will be removed from the sdks in the near future. Please convert to [ExecuteCloudScript](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.server-sidecloudscript.executecloudscript) asap.

- Please stay tuned for a blog post about an internal testing system we call Jenkernaught. Our example projects contain some changes oriented towards deeper testing to improve sdk stability and reliability. Some specifics:
- All testing and examples for CloudScript have been updated to [ExecuteCloudScript](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.server-sidecloudscript.executecloudscript), since RunCloudScript is deprecated.
- All testing and examples for successful login have been updated to `LoginWithCustomID`, to make internal testing easier.

### Cocos2d-xSDK specific changes

- [Cocos2d-xSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/Cocos2d-xSDK)
  - `MultitypeVar` can contain a `PlayFabBaseModel` for the purposes of writing request objects. It still cannot receive an arbitrary json object for results.
  - Initial versioned release.

## 160606  

Date: 2016-06-05

### Global SDK upgrade warning

For consistency across all sdks, the `sdkRevision` variable was renamed to `sdkVersion` ([ActionScriptSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/ActionScriptSDK), [JavaSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/JavaSDK), [UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)).
If you were accessing `sdkRevision`, switch to `sdkVersion`.

### API changes

- Some documentation updates, and improved error notifications.

### SDK global changes

- More steps towards the deprecation of `RunCloudScript`, so customers should plan to migrate to [ExecuteCloudScript](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.server-sidecloudscript.executecloudscript) for live projects.

- Internally, we are halfway through a push to improve testing multi-platform testing for all sdks. [SDKGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator) users may find references to `Jenkernaught` and `buildIdentifier`. `Jenkernaught` is the code-name for the tech that enables this improved platform testing. `buildIdentifier` is a new variable in all sdks indicating the specific PlayFab-Jenkins job which generated a particular sdk version.
- There will be blog-post describing what the `Jenkernaught` does, and more detailed test-framework changes omitted from here, so stay tuned.

### ActionScriptSDK specific changes

- [ActionScriptSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/ActionScriptSDK)
  - `Jenkernaught`-related `ASyncUnitTest` framework changes in the example/testing project.

### CSharpSDK specific changes

- [CSharpSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK)
  - To mirror UnitySDK, we're moving the json-specific code from `PlayFabSettings` to `PlayFabUtil`. We've also expanded `PlayFabUtil` to be closer to feature parity with UnitySDK.
  - Improved documentation in the remaining `PlayFabSettings` options, for clarity.
  - `Jenkernaught` related Unit framework changes in the example/testing project.

### JavaScriptSDK specific changes

- [JavaScriptSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/JavaScriptSDK)
  - Added a utility function to the `PlayFabClientSDK: IsClientLoggedIn()`. Please use this to determine this condition.
  - Minor `Jenkernaught` related test-changes example/testing project.

### NodeSDK specific changes

- [NodeSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/NodeSDK)
  - Added a utility function to the `PlayFabClientSDK: IsClientLoggedIn()`. Please use this to determine this condition.
  - Minor `Jenkernaught` related test-changes example/testing project.

### UnitySDK specific changes

- [UnitySDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK)
  - Fixed a critical bug where PlayFab API calls would stop working if you changed scenes.
  - Adjusted the defaults for timestamp formats to be consistent with other PlayFab SDKs.
  - We are still having issues with Windows-Phone and Windows-Universal for Unity versions 5.3 or higher, which we hope to fix soon.

### Global SDK upgrade warning

Various APIs that save versioned data (UserData, CharacterData, and others) have had a datatype change from int to uint. This will require some users to remove/alter some casting where our api was formerly inconsistent. Some developers may need to change some local variables from int to uint.

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk upgrade warning:**~~ ~~There was a naming conflict between xcode and some of the playfab enums. As a result, we've had to revise the blueprint-enums again, which breaks all PlayFab-api-nodes using enums. The upgrade process in-editor is to delete and re-create each affected blueprint node (they will throw in-editor-compiler warnings if they're affected).~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

### API changes

- There were some `DataVersion` vars which were set to an inconsistent datatype (int and uint in various APIs). All of these have been changed to uint for consistency.

- Some additional options have been added to APIs related to Matchmaking.
- The matchmaker now takes an additional parameter (`StartNewIfNoneFound`), which allows titles to determine whether a new server should spin up if no results are found in the matchmaking process. By default, `StartNewIfNoneFound` is `true`, meaning that a new session will be created if one cannot be found which matches the requirements. This allows titles with skill-based matchmaking to potentially "loosen" the requirements for a match, to get players with skill levels at the far ends of the bell curve into games more quickly.

- Updated the custom game server logic with `GameInstanceState`, which determines whether the game session is available for matchmaking. Games which are `Closed` are not available for matchmaking, allowing developers to create game sessions which are specific to a group of players, as well as to prevent post-start joins of a game session in progress. By default, game servers start in an Open state.
  - New API: [SetGameServerInstanceState](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.matchmaking.setgameserverinstancestate) call can be used by the server to set its state, and `StartOpen` has been added to the `GameModeInfo` used in calls to `ModifyMatchmakerGameModes`, to allow specifying whether sessions in a game mode start as `Open` (the default) or `Closed`.

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk specific changes:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

- ~~Internal SDK updates that make it easier to execute and handle API calls from C++.~~
- ~~Added an internal testing suite which allows thorough verification of PlayFab functionality on all target devices. (Example project only, not the core plugin)~~
- ~~A bunch of C++ code cleanup, and improvements on logging and warnings.~~
- ~~Resolved a concurrency problem with multiple synchronous api calls for Blueprints and C++ calls.~~

## 160502  

Date: 2016-05-01

### Global SDK upgrade warning

  - Some deprecated and internal fields are no longer published with the SDK: ConfirmationMessage and ForceLink.

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk specific changes:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

- ~~Revised the readme and the example project to use a simpler login process, and the new simpler ExecuteCloudScript method.~~
- ~~When there is an api error, the details of that error will report more accurately and display better debug information.~~
- ~~We are removing the "Beta" flagging from Unreal sdks, they are now a full member of our SDK collection, with full support and quality checks.~~

## 160425  

Date: 2016-04-24

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk Upgrade warning:** Many blueprint-api-calls which have enum fields will have to be updated to utilize the enum dropdown. The old value will be lost, and must be re-set. This affects dozens of PlayFab blueprint nodes.~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk specific changes:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

- ~~UnrealBlueprintSdk is nearing the end of its limited-support Beta period. As such, there will be some potentially breaking changes in the next few releases.~~
- ~~There are data fields in the Api-specification defined as enums. Formerly, UnrealBlueprintSdk displayed these fields as arbitrary strings, and the user was expected to input the correct option. This has been fixed. All these fields have been converted to be enum-dropdowns in the blueprints.~~
