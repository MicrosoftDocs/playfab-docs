# Automation with PlayFab

Automation is an important engineering process that greatly improves your efficiency. With PlayFab, you can leverage features such as Actions and Rules, CloudScript, Custom Tags, and Scheduled Tasks. These features provide means to automate processes according to a set of criteria, for example the scenario "upon receiving a new player sign up, automatically send an email to their account and fire telemetry PlayStream events." You have a lot of room to customize your automation, for example with Custom Tags you can enable scenarios such as "when a player purchases an item that belongs to BFF, a custom game category that is tagged, give all their friends 10 coins for free."

Please refer to individual feature pages under Automation for more detailed conceptual documentation and tutorials.
