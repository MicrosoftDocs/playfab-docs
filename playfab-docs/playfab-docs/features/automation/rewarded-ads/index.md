# Rewarded ads
Rewarded video ads let your players choose to watch a short video in exchange for an incentive (usually in-game currency, special items, etc). They are a great way of generating revenue, especially for free-to-play games. 

## What is an ad placement?
An ad placement consists of a list of defined rewards to grant once a player watches an ad. You control the odds of a player recieving a randomized reward by giving each reward a different weight. Additional customization is available by setting a limit on the number of times a player can be rewarded for watching an ad. For example, it's common to set a limit of 3 times per day, per player. This incentivizes players to return to your game day after day.  

Addtionally, leverage player [Segments](../../analytics/segmentation/index.md) to set overrides that allow different groups of players to receive different rewards. For example, reward your VIP players with a special item while other players are rewarded with currency. 

## Why use rewarded ads?
Rewarded ads create incentives for players to engage regularly with your game and offer them greater control over how they choose to engage with in-game advertising. It can result in players spending more time with the game and promote higher retention.
