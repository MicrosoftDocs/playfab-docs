# A/B testing with stores and test buckets

In our [Stores and Sales](../../commerce/stores/stores-and-sales.md) tutorial, we demonstrate how to set up a store and make a few items available to a player at special or alternate prices.

In our [A/B Testing quickstart](quickstart.md), we demonstrate how to create A/B tests and form player
buckets for random, percentage-based user distribution.

This tutorial lets you combine these features, and produce several versions of the store available to different A/B testing groups (buckets).

We first define an A/B test. In this case we define a test called Store A/B Testing, which splits users into 3 groups. The first group (control) contains 34% of all the players. The other 2 test groups each contain 33% of all players, as shown in the example provided below.

Next, we create *one* store to be the original version, and then create 3 *other* stores, which are A/B tested variations of the original.

Each store is created independently, has its own unique identifier, and should have content that is customized for that segment (see below).

Return to the original **Store** page:

- Locate the **SEGMENT OVERRIDES** section.
- It will not only contain the usual **Player Segments**, but it will *also* expose all the **Buckets** for all A/B Tests that you currently have.

Make sure your A/B Test Buckets are on the top of the list, and assign **Store** override settings for each **Bucket**, as shown in the following picture.

Do not forget to *save the settings*. You have an A/B test where players are distributed into 3 groups of **50%**, **30%** and **20%**.

For each group of players, you assign a different version of the store. You may then use A/B testing reports to track user conversion for each version of the store.
