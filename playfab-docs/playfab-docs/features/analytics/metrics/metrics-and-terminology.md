# Metrics and terminology

## Engagement metrics

| Metric                  | Definition                                                                                             |
| :-----------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API Usage**               | **API Usage** statistics are summarized by counts of total calls, total successful calls, and total errors.    |
| **DAU**                     | **Daily Active Users** gives you the count of unique players who logged in on a given day, from 12AM to 11PM UTC.   |
| **Installs**                | The count of installations on new devices, measured by the number of unique device IDs. This number may include both new and returning players.        |
| **Logins**                  | The count of player login events. Unique logins count the number of unique players. The *total* logins counts *all* login events, which can be used to track number of sessions played. Average logins per user tracks the average number of login events per active player.  Note: To obtain an accurate distribution of session counts, we recommend logging in the player on each session start - even if the old login ticket is still valid.   |
| **MAU**                     | **Monthly Active Users**. In the Rolling Thirty Day Totals Report, MAU refers to the count of unique players who logged in during the span of last 30 days. In the Monthly Totals Report, MAU is calculated per month, based on the first and last days of a given month.             |
| **New Users**               | The count of players who logged in for the first time, thus creating new player profiles.              |
| **Retention**               | The percentage of players who logged in again exactly **N** days after a reference date, marked as day **0**. The Thirty Day New User Retention Report considers new users who joined the game within the span of last 30 days. The Thirty Day Retention Report includes both new and returning users who logged into the game within the span of last 30 days.   |

## Revenue metrics

| Metric                  | Definition                                                                                             |
| :-----------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ARPDAU**                  | **Average Revenue Per Daily Active User** in USD.
| **ARPPU**                   | **Average Revenue Per Paying User** within a specified time period (e.g., hourly, daily, or monthly) in USD.
| **ARPU**                    | **Average Revenue Per active User** within a specified time period (e.g., hourly, daily, or monthly) in USD.
| **Average Purchase Price**  | The average transaction amount in USD (= Revenue/Purchases).
| **Conversion**              | The percentage of players who become paying users. The Thirty Day New User Conversion Report tracks purchases made by new user cohorts over a 30 day period. Unlike Retention Reports, the Conversion Report tracks a cumulative total of players who converted within a given time span.
| **Purchases**               | The count of transactions.
| **Top Items**               | The top 100 items which generated the most revenue in your game within a specified report period.
| **Top Spenders**            | The top 100 players who spent the most money in your game within a specified report period.
| **Transaction Revenue**     | The sum of Transaction amounts in USD. Transactions made in other currencies are converted into USD, based on daily exchange rates.
| **Unique Paying Users**     | The count of unique players who spent money in your game.

## Terminology

| Metric               | Definition                                                                                             |
| :--------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cohort**               | A group of players who joined or played the game on a given day, marked as Day 0.
| **Event**                | Events mark the transition between important states in your game, such as a player logging in, making a purchase, leveling up, or dying. A *data event* is a data structure that captures information about the event. PlayFab uses JSON to represent data events. Standard events are generated automatically during use of PlayFab services; games can generate custom events to track other important game-specific events. All data events can be saved, aggregated, reacted to, and analyzed via PlayFabâ€™s real-time data pipeline, known as PlayStream.
| **Platform**             | PlayFab tracks four different types of platforms: OS (iOS, Android), Device Type (iPhone, iPad, Samsung Android, PC, Xbox, etc.), Account Type (Steam, Facebook, Kongregate, Custom, etc.), and Payment Type (iTunes, Google Play, Steam, Facebook, Xsolla, etc.).
| **Segment**              | A group of players who share similar properties, e.g., geography, demographics, platform, purchase patterns, etc. In addition to standard segments, users can define custom segments. Note that segment definitions are limited to properties in the entity profile.
| **Timestamp** (**TS**)       | All PlayFab real-time analytics and reports are based on **Coordinated Universal Time** (**UTC**).
