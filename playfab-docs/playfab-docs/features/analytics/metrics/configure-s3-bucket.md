## Configuring Amazon access

In order to archive events, you will need to give PlayFab access to the bucket on your behalf. This is done by means of an Access Key.

1. Double-check that you have your newly created bucket in the list of **S3** services.
2. Select your account **Name** in the top right corner.
3. Then select **My Security Credentials**, as shown in the drop-down menu below.

- Select the **Create New Access Key** button.
