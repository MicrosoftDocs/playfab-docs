# Reports quickstart

The **Reports** page gives you access to various reports composed from events, and broken down by dates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using **Reports**, make sure you have executed some API calls which have been captured by the **Reports** system already.

## Access reports

To access the **Reports** page:

1. Use the side bar menu and navigate to **Analytics**.

2. Select the **Reports** tab.

## Reports overview

The example shown below shows an overview of the **Reports** page.

1. The first section allows you to filter **Reports** by **Type** (**Name**).

2. The **Date** column lists the time intervals for all **Reports** that have been generated. You can select the **Date** label to access report details for a specific date.

3. The **Name** column identifies the **Report Type** uniquely. You can select the **Name** label to access report details for the corresponding **Date**.

4. When **Report** data is available, you can download a **CSV** representation of the data by selecting **Download CSV**.

5. When **Report** data is *not* available for a given day (no events that day), the **Date** and **Name** labels will render black, will not be selectable, and the option of downloading the report as a **CSV** will not be available.
