# Reports

We know the hard work doesn’t end at launch – that’s just the beginning. To maximize a game’s potential to connect with players, to keep them engaged, and earn revenue, you need to a reporting solution to monitor your progress.  

PlayFab Reports are designed for easy access to the critical metrics of your game at a glance. This set of pre-generated reports is available in the **Analytics** section of Game Manager.

From there, you can dive into daily, monthly, and 30-day rolling views that focus on engagement and monetization. Each report can be downloaded as a CSV for use in custom applications. In addition, you can opt to receive daily summary e-mails delivered to your inbox.
