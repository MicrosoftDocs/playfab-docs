# Daily A/B test KPI report

## Overview

The Daily A/B test Key Performance Indicators (KPI) report shows the outcome of an A/B test, broken down by A and B buckets.

The Key Performance Indicators for A/B tests include:

- **DAU** (Daily Active Users)
- **Average Logins Per User**
- **ARPDAU** (Average Revenue per Daily Active User)
- **Total number of Transactions**
- **Total number of Unique Payers**
- **Average Transactions per Payer**
- **Retention for Day 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30**

## Populating the report

The first step in setting up A/B testing is to create an A/B test using the PlayFab Game Manager. To do this:

1. Select **Automation** from the menu to the left.
2. Go to the **A/B Testing** tab.
3. Create a **New A/B Test** and configure the **A/B test name** and user **Buckets**.
