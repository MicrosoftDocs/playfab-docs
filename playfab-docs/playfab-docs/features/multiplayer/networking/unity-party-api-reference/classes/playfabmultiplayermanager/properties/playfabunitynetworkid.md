# NetworkId

Returns NetworkID of the current network to which the player is connected. The other players can use this string to join the network. The NetworkId is populated when the `OnNetworkJoined` event fires. The NetworkId is cleared when the `OnNetworkLeft` event fires.

```csharp
public string PlayFabMultiplayerManager.NetworkId { get; }
```

## Property Value

NetworkId

[string](/dotnet/api/system.string?view=netcore-3.1&preserve-view=true)

## Remarks

The __NetworkID__, is an opaque serialized network descriptor string generated by the PlayFab Party library that enables each PlayFab Party Unity client to connect to a Party network after one has been created. This string will never contain non-ASCII characters, control characters, or other characters that would require JSON or XML escaping.
