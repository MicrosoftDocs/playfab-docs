# Request access for secured SDKs and samples

This topic provides information about how you can access SDKs and samples for **Nintendo Switch**, **PlayStation&#174;4**, **PlayStation&#174;5**, and **Google Stadia**.

Adhering to platform policies, we need to ensure that you're a registered developer before granting access, so a few extra steps are required from you. For example, you need to be a registered Switch developer to get access to Party SDKs and samples for Switch.

>[!NOTE]
>For other platforms, operating systems, and frameworks, you don't have to request for access to start using Party SDKs and samples.

If you're not yet a registered developer for the previously mentioned platforms and want to become one, go to their developer page to learn more. To become a registered developer for Xbox and PC, go to [ID@Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/Developers/id).

“PlayStation” is a registered trademark or trademark of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc.

## Switch and PlayStation

### Switch, PS4&#8482;, and PS5&#8482;

1. Go to the Nintendo/Sony developer portal, and then find our page (categorized under Middleware).
2. Follow the instructions there. Use their site to send us a notification to let us know that you're a registered developer.

"PS4" is a registered trademark or trademark of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc.

"PS5" is a registered trademark or trademark of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc.

## Stadia

1. Email PlayFabSdkAccess@microsoft.com with your developer information.
2. After we've verified that you're a registered developer for Stadia, we'll grant you access.

## Need help?
