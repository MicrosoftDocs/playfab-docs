# PlayFab Party Pricing

There are four key meters used to bill Party utilization:

1. **Party connectivity.** This is measured in player minutes connected to a network. Metering starts when a player creates a network or joins a network, and it stops when they have disconnected.
2. **Party voice.** This is measured in player minutes speaking. When a player is connected to a network and is actively speaking, that player voice activity is measured and metered.
3. **Party Cognitive Services** This is measured in player minutes using Speech to Text, Text to Speech, or Translation features.
4. **Network egress.** This is data *sent* from PlayFab's relay and voice servers. This is congruent to the aggregate amount of data that players *receive* from the network.
