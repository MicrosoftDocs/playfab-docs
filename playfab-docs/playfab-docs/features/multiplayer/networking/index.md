# Azure PlayFab Party overview

Azure PlayFab Party is a low-latency chat and data communication solution for cross-platform and cross-device multiplayer games. The voice and text features in Party can be used as a standalone chat solution.

For multiplayer games that use a server-client authoritative architecture to curtail competitive cheating concerns or support devices with limited resources, consider multiplayer servers like [PlayFab multiplayer servers](../servers/index.md) to host custom, dedicated game logic in a dynamically scaling cloud environment and use Party for chat communication.
