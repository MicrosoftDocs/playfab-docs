# PartyChatControl::GetAudioManipulationVoiceStream  

Retrieves the audio manipulation voice stream associated with this chat control.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
PartyError GetAudioManipulationVoiceStream(  
    PartyAudioManipulationSourceStream** sourceStream  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
**`sourceStream`** &nbsp; [PartyAudioManipulationSourceStream**](../../PartyAudioManipulationSourceStream/partyaudiomanipulationsourcestream.md)  
*library-allocated output*  
  
The source stream.  
  
  
### Return value  
PartyError
  
```c_partyErrorSuccess``` if the call succeeded or an error code otherwise. The human-readable form of the error code can be retrieved via [PartyManager::GetErrorMessage()](../../PartyManager/methods/partymanager_geterrormessage.md).
  
## Remarks  
  
If this is a local chat control, the stream represents the voice audio detected by the local audio input. Audio provided by this stream will have already been preprocessed with Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Automatic Gain Control (AGC). Audio will only be provided when voice activity is detected. Typically, the app will retrieve audio from this stream via PartyAudioManipulationSourceStream::GetNextBuffer(), process the audio using app logic, and then submit the audio back to the library. The audio is submitted back to the library by retrieving the voice sink stream via PartyLocalChatControl::GetAudioManipulationCaptureStream() and then submitting the buffer via [PartyAudioManipulationSinkStream::SubmitBuffer()](../../PartyAudioManipulationSinkStream/methods/partyaudiomanipulationsinkstream_submitbuffer.md). <br /><br /> Audio generated via [PartyLocalChatControl::SynthesizeTextToSpeech()](../../PartyLocalChatControl/methods/partylocalchatcontrol_synthesizetexttospeech.md) of type [PartySynthesizeTextToSpeechType::VoiceChat](../../../enums/partysynthesizetexttospeechtype.md) will be provided via this source stream, because such audio acts as the associated user's voice.   <br /><br /> Audio retrieved via this stream will not have been transcribed via speech-to-text for voice chat transcription. Audio that is submitted to a sink stream via PartyAudioManipulationSinkStream::SubmitBuffer() will be transcribed, if transcription options configured via [PartyLocalChatControl::SetTranscriptionOptions](../../PartyLocalChatControl/methods/partylocalchatcontrol_settranscriptionoptions.md) indicates that audio associated the sink's chat control should be.   <br /><br /> If this a remote chat control, the stream represents the chat control's incoming voice audio. Typically, the app will retrieve audio from the voice streams associated with all remote chat controls via PartyAudioManipulationSourceStream::GetNextBuffer(), process and mix each buffer into a single audio stream, and then submit the mixed stream to be rendered by each appropriate sink stream. Each render stream can be retrieved via PartyLocalChatControl::GetAudioManipulationRenderStream().
