# PartyLocalChatControl::ConfigureAudioManipulationRenderStream  

Queues an asynchronous operation to configure the audio manipulation render stream.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
PartyError ConfigureAudioManipulationRenderStream(  
    PartyAudioManipulationSinkStreamConfiguration* configuration,  
    void* asyncIdentifier  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
**`configuration`** &nbsp; [PartyAudioManipulationSinkStreamConfiguration*](../../../structs/partyaudiomanipulationsinkstreamconfiguration.md)  
*optional*  
  
The stream configuration.  
  
**`asyncIdentifier`** &nbsp; void*  
*optional*  
  
An optional, app-defined, pointer-sized context value that can be used to associate the completion state change with this call.  
  
  
### Return value  
PartyError
  
```c_partyErrorSuccess``` if the call succeeded or an error code otherwise. The human-readable form of the error code can be retrieved via [PartyManager::GetErrorMessage()](../../PartyManager/methods/partymanager_geterrormessage.md).
  
## Remarks  
  
If the configuration is non-null, an audio manipulation render stream will be created for this chat control. Such a stream acts as the render pipeline for audio that will be rendered to this chat control. If the configuration is null, and a stream has previously been configured, the stream will be destroyed. <br /><br /> Upon completion of the asynchronous operation, when a non-null configuration was specified, a render stream for this chat control can be queried via [PartyLocalChatControl::GetAudioManipulationRenderStream()](partylocalchatcontrol_getaudiomanipulationrenderstream.md). Completion is indicated by a [PartyConfigureAudioManipulationRenderStreamCompletedStateChange](../../../structs/partyconfigureaudiomanipulationrenderstreamcompletedstatechange.md).   

### Platform support and supported formats

 This function is only supported on Windows and Xbox. Calls on other platforms will fail.   <br /><br /> The following format options are supported.   <br /><br />

| Format option | Supported value(s) |
| --- | --- |
| Samples per second | Any value between 8 kHz and 48 kHz, inclusive. |
| Channel mask | Any value |
| Channel count | Any value between 1 and 64, inclusive. |
| Bits per sample | If sample type is ```PartyAudioSampleType::Float```, 32. If sample type is ```PartyAudioSampleType::Integer```, 16 or 32. |
| Sample type | ```PartyAudioSampleType::Float``` or ```PartyAudioSampleType::Integer``` |
| Interleaved | true or false |
