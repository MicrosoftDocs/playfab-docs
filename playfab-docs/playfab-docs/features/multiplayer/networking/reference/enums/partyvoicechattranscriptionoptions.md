# PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionOptions  

Voice chat transcription options.    

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
enum class PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionOptions    
{  
    None = 0x0,  
    TranscribeSelf = 0x1,  
    TranscribeOtherChatControlsWithMatchingLanguages = 0x2,  
    TranscribeOtherChatControlsWithNonMatchingLanguages = 0x4,  
    TranslateToLocalLanguage = 0x10,  
    DisableProfanityMasking = 0x20,  
    TranscribeSelfRegardlessOfNetworkState = 0x40,  
}  
```  
  
## Constants  
  
| Constant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None | No chat controls will be transcribed. |  
| TranscribeSelf | Transcriptions of the local chat control will be generated and provided to the same local chat control via [PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionReceivedStateChange](../structs/partyvoicechattranscriptionreceivedstatechange.md) events while in a network with at least one other chat control. |  
| TranscribeOtherChatControlsWithMatchingLanguages | Transcriptions of other chat controls with the same language as the local chat control will be generated and provided to the local chat control via [PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionReceivedStateChange](../structs/partyvoicechattranscriptionreceivedstatechange.md) events. |  
| TranscribeOtherChatControlsWithNonMatchingLanguages | Transcriptions of other chat controls with languages that are different from the local chat control's language will be generated and provided to the local chat control via [PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionReceivedStateChange](../structs/partyvoicechattranscriptionreceivedstatechange.md) events.<br/><br/> The transcriptions are not translated by default. Translation to the local chat control's language can also be enabled by adding *TranslateToLocalLanguage*. |  
| TranslateToLocalLanguage | Transcriptions will be translated to the local chat control's language.<br/><br/> Transcriptions generated as specified via other PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionOptions values will be translated into the local chat control's language, which is specified by [PartyLocalChatControl::GetLanguage()](../classes/PartyLocalChatControl/methods/partylocalchatcontrol_getlanguage.md). The translations will be provided in addition to the original transcription via [PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionReceivedStateChange](../structs/partyvoicechattranscriptionreceivedstatechange.md) events. <br /><br /> If translation is enabled, a translation corresponding to the local chat control's language will always be provided in each resulting PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionReceivedStateChange. If the speaking chat control's language is the same as the local chat control's language, the transcription and translation strings will be identical.   <br /><br /> This option will have no effect unless also combined with one or more of *TranscribeSelf*, *TranscribeOtherChatControlsWithMatchingLanguages*, and *TranscribeOtherChatControlsWithNonMatchingLanguages*. |  
| DisableProfanityMasking | Transcriptions will be provided without masking profanity.<br/><br/> By default, profanity is masked by replacing each character with an asterisk. For instance, a 4-letter profanity is replaced with "****". When this option is enabled, no masking will be applied to profanity; the raw text will be provided. |  
| TranscribeSelfRegardlessOfNetworkState | Transcriptions of the local chat control will be generated and provided to the same local chat control via [PartyVoiceChatTranscriptionReceivedStateChange](../structs/partyvoicechattranscriptionreceivedstatechange.md) regardless of whether the chat control is in a network with any other chat controls.<br/><br/> This option overrides *TranscribeSelf*. This option is provided for backwards compatibility and typically should not be used. |
