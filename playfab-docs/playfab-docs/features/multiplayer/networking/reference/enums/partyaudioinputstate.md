# PartyAudioInputState  

States of an audio input associated with a local chat control.    

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
enum class PartyAudioInputState    
{  
    NoInput = 0,  
    Initialized = 1,  
    NotFound = 2,  
    UserConsentDenied = 3,  
    UnsupportedFormat = 4,  
    AlreadyInUse = 5,  
    UnknownError = 6,  
}  
```  
  
## Constants  
  
| Constant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NoInput | No audio input was specified. |  
| Initialized | The audio input was successfully initialized. |  
| NotFound | The audio input wasn't found.<br/><br/> This can occur if the input was removed while in use. When in this state, the chat control will subscribe to audio device changes and use the specified input if it can be found at a later time. |
