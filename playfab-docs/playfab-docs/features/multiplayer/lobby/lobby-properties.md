# Lobby properties
 

This article describes custom properties stored on the lobby. Use this functionality to store metadata about the game sessions that your lobby's represent.

## Pre-defined properties

Each lobby has a set of pre-defined properties commonly needed for most game scenarios.

| Property     | Definition        |
|--------------|-------------------|
| lobbyId      | This is the unique identifier for a lobby. It can be used to distinguish between multiple lobbies that a player may be a part of. |
| connectionString  | The identifier used to join the lobby. It is provided by the Lobby service. When an invite is sent to other players, the __connectionString__ is sent as the invitation. |
| maxMemberCount   | The maximum number of players allowed in the lobby. This property can only be changed by owner. |
| owner  | The entity that owns the lobby. Some lobbies may temporarily be ownerless in some circumstances. To learn more, see [Ownership changes](ownership-changes.md). |
| ownerMigrationPolicy | Policy determines how a new owner will be chosen. To learn more, see [Ownership changes](ownership-changes.md). |
| accessPolicy | Policy indicates who can discover the lobby's connection string. This property can only be changed by the owner. |
| membershipLock  | This value indicates whether new members may join the lobby or not. When __Locked__, new members may not join. When __Unlocked__ new members may join. This property can only be changed by the owner. |

## Custom Properties

There are 3 types of custom properties that titles can define. 

1. Custom lobby properties
    * These properties apply to the whole lobby.
    * Only members of the lobby can see these properties.
    * Only the owner of the lobby can change these properties.
2. Custom member properties
    * There is a unique map of member properties for each member in the lobby
    * Only members of the lobby can see these properties.
    * All members of the lobby can see every other members' properties.
    * Each member may modify their own member properties but cannot modify another member's properties.
    * Once a member leaves the lobby, their member properties are deleted from the lobby.
3. Custom search properties.
    * These are special properties which can be used by all players in your title to search for lobbies matching a specific criteria.
    * These properties apply to the whole lobby.
    * Only the owner of the lobby can change these properties.
    * There are restrictions on what keys you can use for these properties.
    * To learn more, see [Create searchable lobbies](define-search-keywords.md).

All properties are maps of key-value pairs.
