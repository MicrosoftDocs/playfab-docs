```cpp
struct PFLobbyUpdatedStateChange : PFLobbyStateChange {  
    PFLobbyHandle lobby;  
    bool ownerUpdated;  
    bool maxMembersUpdated;  
    bool accessPolicyUpdated;  
    bool membershipLockUpdated;  
    uint32_t updatedSearchPropertyCount;  
    const char* const* updatedSearchPropertyKeys;  
    uint32_t updatedLobbyPropertyCount;  
    const char* const* updatedLobbyPropertyKeys;  
    uint32_t memberUpdateCount;  
    const PFLobbyMemberUpdateSummary* memberUpdates;  
}  
```

**`updatedSearchPropertyKeys`** &nbsp; const char* const*  
*array of size `updatedSearchPropertyCount`*  
  
The keys of the search properties which have been updated.
  
**`updatedLobbyPropertyCount`** &nbsp; uint32_t

**`updatedLobbyPropertyKeys`** &nbsp; const char* const*  
*array of size `updatedLobbyPropertyCount`*

**`memberUpdateCount`** &nbsp; uint32_t

## Remarks  
  
This state change signifies that the lobby has updated and provides hints as to which values have changed. Multiple updates may be provided by a single call to [PFMultiplayerStartProcessingLobbyStateChanges()](../functions/pfmultiplayerstartprocessinglobbystatechanges.md). All state reflected by these updates will become available simultaneously when PFMultiplayerStartProcessingLobbyStateChanges() is called, so the updates can be reconciled either individually or as a batch.
