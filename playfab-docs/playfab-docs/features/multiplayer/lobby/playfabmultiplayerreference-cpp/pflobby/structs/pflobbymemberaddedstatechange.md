# PFLobbyMemberAddedStateChange  

Information specific to the *MemberAdded* type of state change.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
struct PFLobbyMemberAddedStateChange : PFLobbyStateChange {  
    PFLobbyHandle lobby;  
    PFEntityKey member;  
}  
```
  
### Members  
  
**`lobby`** &nbsp; PFLobbyHandle  
*must not be null*  
  
The lobby the new member was added to.
  
**`member`** &nbsp; [PFEntityKey](../../pfmultiplayer/pfentitykey_clientsdk.md)  
  
The PlayFab entity which is now a member of the lobby.
  
## Remarks  
  
This state change will be generated by all operations which add members to lobbies such as [PFMultiplayerCreateAndJoinLobby](../functions/pfmultiplayercreateandjoinlobby.md), [PFMultiplayerJoinLobby](../functions/pfmultiplayerjoinlobby.md), and [PFLobbyAddMember](../functions/pflobbyaddmember.md). <br /><br /> When this state change is provided by [PFMultiplayerStartProcessingLobbyStateChanges](../functions/pfmultiplayerstartprocessinglobbystatechanges.md) the lobby will update to reflect the new member in the member list and the member's initial properties will become queryable.
  
## Requirements
