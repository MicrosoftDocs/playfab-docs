```cpp
HRESULT PFMultiplayerJoinArrangedLobby(  
    PFMultiplayerHandle handle,  
    const PFEntityKey* newMember,  
    const char* arrangementString,  
    const PFLobbyArrangedJoinConfiguration* configuration,  
    void* asyncContext,  
    PFLobbyHandle* lobby  
)  
```

*optional*  
  
An optional, app-defined, pointer-sized context value that can be used to associate the completion state change with this call.  
  
**`lobby`** &nbsp; PFLobbyHandle*  
*optional, library-allocated output*  
  
The optional, output lobby object which can be used to queue operations for immediate execution of this operation completes.  
  
  
### Return value
Type: HRESULT
  
```S_OK``` if the call succeeded or an error code otherwise. The human-readable form of the error code can be retrieved via [PFMultiplayerGetErrorMessage()](../../pfmultiplayer/functions/pfmultiplayergeterrormessage.md).
  
## Remarks  
  
This is an asynchronous operation. Upon successful completion, the title will be provided a [PFLobbyMemberAddedStateChange](../structs/pflobbymemberaddedstatechange.md) followed by a [PFLobbyJoinArrangedLobbyCompletedStateChange](../structs/pflobbyjoinarrangedlobbycompletedstatechange.md) with the [PFLobbyJoinArrangedLobbyCompletedStateChange::result](../structs/pflobbyjoinarrangedlobbycompletedstatechange.md) field set to ```S_OK```. Upon a failed completion, the title will be provided a [PFLobbyJoinArrangedLobbyCompletedStateChange](../structs/pflobbyjoinarrangedlobbycompletedstatechange.md) with the [PFLobbyJoinArrangedLobbyCompletedStateChange::result](../structs/pflobbyjoinarrangedlobbycompletedstatechange.md) field set to a failure. <br /><br /> When using matchmaking through this library, the [PFMatchmakingMatchDetails::lobbyArrangementString](../../pfmatchmaking/structs/pfmatchmakingmatchdetails.md) can be used with this method to join a lobby with all of the users that have been matched together.
