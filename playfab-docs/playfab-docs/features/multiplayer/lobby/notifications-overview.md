## Lobby changes

Whenever lobby properties change, message notifications can be sent to owners and members of the lobby. 

Use __SubscribeToLobbyResource__ to subscribe players to lobby change notifications.

## Lobby invites

Use __InviteToLobby__ when an invite is sent. This allows the player who receives the invite to get a notification.
