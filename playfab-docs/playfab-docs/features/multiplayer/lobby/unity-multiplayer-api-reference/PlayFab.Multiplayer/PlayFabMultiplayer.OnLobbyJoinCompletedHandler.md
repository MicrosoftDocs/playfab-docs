public delegate void OnLobbyJoinCompletedHandler(Lobby lobby, PFEntityKey newMember, int result);
```

| --- | --- |
| lobby | The lobby involved with the operation. |
| newMember | The local member entity provided to the call associated with this state change which is joining this lobby. |
| result | Indicates that the JoinArrangedLobby operation Succeeded or provides the reason that it failed. |

## Remarks

[`OnLobbyMemberAdded`](./PlayFabMultiplayer/OnLobbyMemberAdded.md) event fires anytime any member is added to the lobby (remote or local). [`OnAddMemberCompleted`](./PlayFabMultiplayer/OnAddMemberCompleted.md) event only fires when you invoke !:PlayFabMultiplayer.AddMember which allows you to add additional members to the lobby. The first local member was the one who created the lobby, it will fire the [`OnLobbyCreateAndJoinCompleted`](./PlayFabMultiplayer/OnLobbyCreateAndJoinCompleted.md) event. If the local member is using [`JoinLobby`](./PlayFabMultiplayer/JoinLobby.md), it will fire the [`OnLobbyJoinCompleted`](./PlayFabMultiplayer/OnLobbyJoinCompleted.md) event. If the local member is using [`JoinArrangedLobby`](./PlayFabMultiplayer/JoinArrangedLobby.md), it will fire the [`OnLobbyJoinArrangedLobbyCompleted`](./PlayFabMultiplayer/OnLobbyJoinArrangedLobbyCompleted.md) event.
