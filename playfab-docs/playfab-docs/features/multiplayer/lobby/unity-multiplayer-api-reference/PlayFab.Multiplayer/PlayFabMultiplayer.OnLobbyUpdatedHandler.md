# PlayFabMultiplayer.OnLobbyUpdatedHandler delegate

Handler for when a lobby was updated.

This state change signifies that the lobby has updated and provides hints as to which values have changed. Multiple updates may be provided by a single call to !:ProcessingLobbyStateChanges(). All state reflected by these updates will become available simultaneously when ProcessingLobbyStateChanges() is called, so the updates can be reconciled either individually or as a batch.

```csharp
public delegate void OnLobbyUpdatedHandler(Lobby lobby, bool ownerUpdated, bool maxMembersUpdated, 
    bool accessPolicyUpdated, bool membershipLockUpdated, IList<string> updatedSearchPropertyKeys, 
    IList<string> updatedLobbyPropertyKeys, IList<LobbyMemberUpdateSummary> memberUpdates);
```
