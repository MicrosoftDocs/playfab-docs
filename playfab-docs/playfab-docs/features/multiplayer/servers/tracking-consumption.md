# Tracking title consumption of multiplayer servers

In the Multiplayer section of the Game Manager, there is an "Analytics" page on the Servers tab that you can use to track server consumption. For multiplayer-focused games, server spend can be significant and these tools help you monitor your estimated bill.

The time-series data available to you via this monitoring experience is a graph showing compute-hours (y-axis) over time (x-axis). You can adjust the time range.
