# Managing Server Cores Quota

Multiplayer Servers includes a free and limited capacity of simultaneous cores to evaluate the building of multiplayer server games.  Game developers enrolled in paid pricing plans, however, may request additional server cores for their game title(s).  Requesting additional quota will increase the maximum number of cores that your multiplayer service has access to if the request is approved.  The **Multiplayer Servers | Quota Summary** page presents a self-serve mechanism in Game Manager for game developers to:

- **Request additional quota**
- **Review a history of quota requests provisioned or under review**

## Requesting additional quota

To request additional quota, access the **Change Quota** button on the **Multiplayer Servers | Quota Summary** page as shown in the screenshot below to request for additional quota.  Changing your quota limit will not increase your costs. Increased player activity results in more active servers. Active server usage and costs will be reflected in your bill.  Most requests will be immediately approved and provisioned.  But some core limit changes are subject to review and may require more information if your request exceeds what can be provide at the time of the request.

### How to request quota changes

1. Briefly describe the change requests.  Examples include the name of your launch, event name or title game mode.
2. Select the **+ Add change** button to request a quota change as shown in the screenshot below.  Quota changes may include 1 or more changes to a VM family and region combination.  Only VM family SKUs and regions permitted in your pricing plan will surface in the options to choose from.
3. Apply a new core limit to adjust the quota to a VM family and region combination.  The new core limit can be any number between zero (0) and the desired quota for your title.  A value of 0 indicates you are removing all quota for the VM family SKU & region combination.
4. Select the **+Add change** button to specify a specific SKU and region combination of quota change requests
5. To delete a quota change before it is submitted, select the checkbox for that row and then **Delete**
6. After adding all SKU/region quota changes, select **Submit** to submit your quota change request.

7. After processing your request, if it is approved a notification will surface at the top of the Game Manager indicating your request was approved.  You may verify your changes were made by accessing the View Quota page by selecting the **View Quota** button at the top of the **Multiplayer Servers | Quota Summary** page.

8. If your request is too large to approve immediately, you will be prompted to provide additional details of your quota change request as in (a) start date desired and (b) notes to help assess the change.  Examples include forecast title metrics (e.g. daily active users, concurrent game players per second, etc.).  This information will be manually reviewed by PlayFab who will be in contact with you regarding the status of your quota change request.

## Reviewing quota requests

To review a history of quota requests submitted for a title, access the Multiplayer Servers | Quota Summary page and scroll to the Change History section on the page.  This section tabularizes a history of requests submitted and their current status.
