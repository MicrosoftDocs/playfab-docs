# Adding ratings to your user generated content

This guide will go through the API calls that can be used to add a ratings and review system to your game.

## Review an item

A rating or review can be attached to an item by calling the `ReviewItem` API from a client. In order for an item to be reviewed it must be visible in the public catalog for all players. Ratings and reviews are attached to the player calling the API and only a single review per player can be associated with an item. The creator of an item cannot submit a review for their own item. The review is updated every time `ReviewItem` is called. The following data is **required** for the call:

- `Id`: The unique ID of item that is wished to be reviewed.
- `Rating`: A numeric rating the form of a `1` to `5` scale.

In addition, a number of **optional** parameters can also be added:

- `Title`: The title for the review.
- `ReviewText`: A free text field for reviews.
- `IsInstalled`: A flag to indicate if the reviewer has the item.
- `ItemVersion`: The version number for the item being reviewed.

As a service call, that looks something like this:

```json

{
  "Review": {
    "ItemVersion": "2.4.1",
    "Rating": 5,
    "Title": "Best Game Ever",
    "ReviewText": "I play this game every day. It's my favorite game yet.",
    "IsInstalled": true
  },
  "Id": "3f5dd8d4-4ee1-4748-8855-56a8a0277bf9"
}
```

A `Submitted` timestamp is automatically populated and updated when a review is submitted.

## Get a player's review for an item

You can get a player's review for an item by calling the `GetEntityItemReview` API from a client. An item `Id` or `AlternateId` must be provided. A specific `ReviewId` associated with review will be returned.

```json
{
    "code": 200,
    "status": "OK",
    "data": {
        "Review": {
            "ReviewId": "730de69c-d6af-f313-4653-09fb14bedeef",
            "ItemId": "3f5dd8d4-4ee1-4748-8855-56a8a0277bf9",
            "ReviewerId": "title_player_account!218870DE55036998",
            "ItemVersion": "2.4.1",
            "Title": "Best Game Ever",
            "ReviewText": "I play this game every day. It's my favorite game yet.",
            "Rating": 5,
            "IsInstalled": true,
            "Locale": "NEUTRAL",
            "HelpfulnessVotes": 0,
            "HelpfulPositive": 0,
            "HelpfulNegative": 0,
            "Submitted": "2021-08-09T06:44:22.569Z"
        }
    }
}
```

Calling `GetEntityItemReview` from a player who hasn't made a review returns a Review object with zeroed values:

```json
{
    "code": 200,
    "status": "OK",
    "data": {
        "Review": {
            "ReviewId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "Rating": 0,
            "IsInstalled": false,
            "HelpfulnessVotes": 0,
            "HelpfulPositive": 0,
            "HelpfulNegative": 0,
            "Submitted": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
    }
}
```

## Get reviews for an item

You can access all the reviews **containing text** for an item by calling the `GetItemReviews` API. An item `Id` or `AlternateId` must be provided. Additional **optional** parameters can be added:

- `ContinuationToken`: An opaque token used to retrieve the next page of items, if any are available.
- `Count`: Number of items to retrieve. Maximum page size is 200\. If not specified, defaults to 10.
- `OrderBy`: An OData orderBy used to order the results of the query. Possible values are `Helpfulness`, `Rating`, and `Submitted`.

```json
{
  "Count": 2,
  "Id": "3f5dd8d4-4ee1-4748-8855-56a8a0277bf9",
  "OrderBy": "Submitted desc"
}
```

## Submit a helpfulness vote for a review

Players can submit a helpfulness vote for a review by calling the `SubmitItemReviewVote` API. Submitting a new helpfulness vote will increment `HelpfulPositive` or `HelpfulNegative` depending on the boolean value for the `Vote` parameter.

```json
{
  "ReviewId": "730de69c-d6af-f313-4653-09fb14bedeef",
  "Vote": "Helpful/UnHelpful"
}
```

## Report a review

Players can report a review by calling the `ReportItemReview` API from a client. A `ReviewId` must be provided. An additional **optional** `ConcernCategory` parameter can be added.

```json
{
  "ReviewId": "730de69c-d6af-f313-4653-09fb14bedeef",
  "ConcernCategory": "OffensiveContent"
}
```

If not specified, `ConcernCategory` will default to `None`. The valid `ConcernCategory` values are as follows:

- `None`
- `OffensiveContent`
- `ChildExploitation`
- `MalwareOrVirus`
- `PrivacyConcerns`
- `MisleadingApp`
- `PoorPerformance`
- `ReviewResponse`
- `SpamAdvertising`
- `Profanity`

Calling the `ReportItemReview` will **only** fire a PlayStream event under the Event Name, `item_reported`. This can be queried using the Data Explorer in the Game Manager. Example Kusto queries can be seen below:

The following query returns **The total number of reports by ConcernCategory per ItemId in the last 3 days**

```kusto
['events.all']
| where Timestamp > ago (3d)
| where FullName_Name == "review_reported"
| project ReviewId = tostring(EventData.Payload.ReviewId), ConcernCategory = tostring(EventData.Payload.ConcernCategory)
| summarize TotalReportCount = count() by ReviewId, ConcernCategory
| sort by TotalReportCount desc
| render columnchart kind=stacked
```

## Takedown a review

You can submit a request to takedown one or more reviews using the `TakedownItemReviews` API. This API can only be called by the **title entity**. The call takes in a set of reviews that is to be taken down.

```json
{
  "Reviews": [
    {
      "ItemId": "3f5dd8d4-4ee1-4748-8855-56a8a0277bf9",
      "ReviewId": "730de69c-d6af-f313-4653-09fb14bedeef"
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>There can be a delay of up to 24 hours until a review is taken down due to the request processing

## Ratings design and caching
We have two methods for getting ratings. The difference between the two paths is whether you are interacting with the review directly or the catalog item.

1.	We provide ratings directly (via `GetItemReviews`, etc.)
2.	We provide ratings aggregates in the catalog items (via `SearchItems`, etc.)

Both routes are asynchronous and have timing delays that it is important to understand.

### Direct Ratings (GetItemReviews, etc.)
All these ratings and reviews are served directly. There are two categories of latency here.

1.	Individual Reviews - *Near Real Time*  
Individual reviews will not available immediately, but should show up within a few seconds. We expect that retrying with a backoff will be sufficient for reading a brand-new review.


2.	Aggregate Ratings - *Under 15 minutes*    
There's a cache for aggregates

### Catalog Item Ratings (SearchItems, etc.)
All these ratings are served as part of the catalog item from our published catalog.

1.	Aggregate Ratings - *Under 8 hours*  
The system aggregates the ratings and pushes updates into the catalog which can take anywhere from 4-8 hours.
