# Item Permissions and Visibility

Catalog Items can be given different parameters and values that change whether the item is visible to different players through the public catalog or other APIs. This document will go over the different states an item can be in and how it can affect who can see or modify them.

## Unpublished Draft Items
These are Draft items that are created using the `CreateDraftItem` and have not been published. These items are available to only the Item Creator, [Catalog Admins](/gaming/playfab/features/commerce/ugc/settings/#catalog-admins), and [Title Entities](/gaming/playfab/features/data/entities/#title). Both `GetDraftItem` and `UpdateDraftItem` can be called on these items.

## Published Items
Published Items that have a valid start and end date pair (ie. StartDate < CurrentDate < EndDate), are visible to all players via the Public Catalog. Players can access published items using the `SearchItems` and `GetItem` APIs.

## Scheduled Items
Scheduled Items are Published Items that have future start date (ie. CurrentDate < StartDate). These items are only accessible by the Item Creator, Catalog Admins, Catalog Reviewers, and Title Entities. These items will **not** show up in the Published Catalog and cannot be accessed using `GetItem` API for regular players.

## Expired Items

Expired Items are Published Items that have past end date (ie. CurrentDate > EndDate). These items will **not** show up in the Published Catalog via the `SearchItems` API but these items **can** be accessed using `GetItem` API for all players.

## Hidden Items

Expired Items are Published Items that have the `IsHidden` flag set to true. These items will **not** show up in the Published Catalog via the `SearchItems` API but these items **can** be accessed using `GetItem` API for all players.

## Non-Approved Moderated Items

Via the [Moderation APIs](/gaming/playfab/features/commerce/ugc/moderation), Published Items can be set with a moderation status. Published Items that have any status that is not `Approved` (ie. `AwaitingModeration`, `Rejected`, or `Unknown`) are only accessible by the Item Creator, Catalog Admins, and Title Entities. These items will **not** show up in the Published Catalog and cannot be accessed using `GetItem` API for regular players.
