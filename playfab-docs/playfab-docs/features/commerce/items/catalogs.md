# Catalogs

This tutorial describes the **Catalogs** tab in the **Economy** section in **Game Manager**. Catalogs are used to define items that the player can purchase or that you can award to a player.

## What is a catalog?

Many games offer the player items for purchase such as a shield, a level-unlock, or a power-up. These items are specified in a catalog in units of either virtual currency or real money. Catalogs offer an easy way to manage your game's virtual items. They are listings of every item available in your game.

However, before a player can purchase an item from a catalog, you must first create the items that you want to populate it.

PlayFabâ€™s [Player Item Management (Server)](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement) and [Player Item Management (Client)](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playeritemmanagement) APIs support many strategies for item purchasing, including the following:

- Simple real money or virtual currency purchases of items.
- Triggered item grants based on buying another item.
- Locked (with a potentially purchasable key) and unlocked boxes.
- Random result tables.
- Non-purchasable items that are granted based on events within a game.

> [!NOTE]
> In catalogs, the currency type of **RM** is reserved for **real money**, which is in cents USD. $1.99 is represented as **RM 199**.

## Field reference

This section describes each field in the **Catalogs** section of the **Economy** area in **Game Manager**.

When you first create a title, you have no catalogs. You won't see any fields in the **Catalogs** section until you create a catalog by selecting the **NEW CATALOG** button.

Once a catalog is created, you will see the following tabs in the **Catalogs** section:

- **Items** - Things that have a value in virtual currency or real money that can be purchased or awarded. See [PlayFab items](index.md) for more information.
- **Bundles** - Collections of items and virtual currency that unpack into a player's inventory when granted.
- **Containers** - Collections of items and virtual currency that remain as an item in the player's inventory until opened.
- **Drop Tables** - Collections of items and virtual currency you can use to reward players.
- **Stores** - Stores serve a subset of catalog items. These items can be offered at alternative prices to those set in the catalog. See [PlayFab Stores](../stores/index.md) for more information.

### New Catalog fields

## Example of Catalog creation

To create a **Catalog**:

1. Open **Game Manager** and select **Economy** on the left side bar.
2. Select the **Catalogs** tab.
3. Select the **NEW CATALOG** button.

4. Enter a **Catalog version** (like *My Catalog*).
   - An item with the ID of **One** is added automatically.
5. Select **One**. (This opens the **Edit Catalog Item** page which has the same fields as the [**New Catalog Item**](#new-catalog-item-fields) page described above).
   - Edit or add some properties, such as:
       - **Item ID** (e.g. **shield_level_5**).
       - **Display name** (e.g. **Level 5 Shield**).
       - **Description** (e.g. **Strong defense against projectile attacks**).
6. Set a price by selecting a currency and amount, for example:
   - Set the **Currency** to **Gold**, (See [Currencies](../economy/currencies.md) for more information on this.)
   - Set the **Amount** to **250**).
7. Select **SAVE ITEM**.
8. This returns you to the **Items** page for your catalog. To add more items, select **NEW ITEM** and repeat steps 5 â€“ 7.
