# Titles in Development mode

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you're ready to scale up, it's important to make sure you switch your title from "Development mode" to "Live". This is achieved using the Launch button (on the Game Overview page or the PlayFab main dashboard where you see all your studios and titles), so that the title isn't limited to 100K player accounts.

All PlayFab titles are in one of two possible states - development mode and live. Development mode is, as the name suggests, meant for titles currently in development. This mode provides developers with the flexibility to connect a title to PlayFab without running up the bill.

A title in development mode can only have up to 100 K users. These titles can be [launched](../pricing/account-upgrades.md) through Game Manager and is then considered live. Launching a title removes all development mode limitations and allows the title to expand outside of test markets.

By default, every title created starts in development mode. The **My Studios and Titles** main page will indicate which state a title is in through a mark on the bottom, left corner of the title block. This indicator can also be viewed at the top of the left nav within a title. Titles in development mode are labeled **Development**. Live titles are blank.

> [!NOTE]
> As long as your title is in development mode, consumption is not counted towards any of your billable meters.

The example below shows how meter consumption is reflected in the billing for a fictional customer called Fun Studios:

| Title | Title mode | Meter Consumption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fun Game | Live | 1M PlayStream Events |
| Fun Game 2: The Return of Fun | Development mode | 100K PlayStream Events

When Fun Studios visits their Billing Summary page, they only see the consumption for their Live title, Fun Game, count against their Standard Plan included resources.

**For more information on these topics, check out these pages:**
 - [Meters](../pricing/Meters/meters.md)
 - [Upgrades](../pricing/account-upgrades.md)
 - [Billing Summary](../pricing/billingDetails.md)

## Limits
There are some studio and title limits associated with development mode:

### Studio Limits
| Limit | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Titles in Development mode | 10 Titles |

### Title Limits
| Limit | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Unique Users | 100,000 Users |
| PlayStream Events | 1M Events |
| Telemetry Events | 1M Events |
| Profile Reads | 5M Reads |
| Profile Writes | 1M Writes |
| Profile Storage | 2 GB |

| CloudScript Execution Time | 20 K GB-s |
| CloudScript Total Executions | 200 K Executions |
| Insights Credits | Insights Performance Level 1 |

**Definition of Unique Users:**
Unique Users are simply the total number of player profiles you have in your title, which is different from MAU - you can delete player profiles through the Players page in Game Manager to reduce the total number of Unique Users if you're approaching the limit but aren't ready to launch your title

> [!NOTE]
> You can learn more about title limits at [PlayFab pricing](https://www.playfab.com/pricing).
