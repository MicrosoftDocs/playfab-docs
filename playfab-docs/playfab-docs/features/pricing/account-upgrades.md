A PlayFab account has five plan options:
1. **FREE TO START :** This plan has no cost to the customer. Studios that belong to free accounts may only contain titles that are in [development mode](../pricing/Development-Mode.md). Once a title reaches its development mode limits, it must be launched by upgrading to a paid plan. To learn how to launch a title, see Title Launches.Once a title reaches its development mode limits, it must be launched by upgrading to a paid plan.

2. **PAY-AS-YOU-GO :** This paid plan has no monthly base rate. Accounts are only charged for their monthly consumption for live titles. 
3. **STANDARD :** This paid plan has a monthly base rate and private support options ([Paid Technical Support](../pricing/PaidTechnicalSupport.md)). This plan comes with included meter usage amounts that live titles associated with the account may access. Once the included meter amounts have been used, the account will be charged for additional consumption.

## Understanding the Account-Studio-Title Relationship
An account is linked to one Studio and a Studio may be linked to many titles. Upgrades are executed at the account level and launches are executed at the Title level.

## FAQ

**How do I know which subscription plan my account and its associated studios are currently on?**
There are two ways to know which plan your account is currently on.

**1. Presence of Upgrade Account Button:**  Navigate to the "My Studios" page. If a Studio displays the **Upgrade Account** button, the Studio and its associated account are currently free and have no account plan (1).

**2. Base Rate Amount:** While on the "My Studios" page, if no "Upgrade Account" button is present, navigate to the **Billing Summary** page (3). A lack of the **Upgrade Account** button means that the Studio and its associated account are on a paid subscription plan.

The amount of the base rate will represent the paid subscription plan of an account. A Base Rate of **$99** indicates that the Studio and its associated account are on the **Standard plan**. A base rate of **$1999** indicates that the Studio and its associated account are on the **Premium plan**. The Premium plan can only be acquired through contacting PlayFab.

**How do I know which subscription plan I am upgrading my account to?**
All accounts upgraded through Game Manager are automatically upgraded to the Standard plan, as indicated by the agreed-to base rate listed within the **Upgrade Account**(1) flow.

To upgrade to a Premium plan, please [contact PlayFab](./paidtechnicalsupport.md).
