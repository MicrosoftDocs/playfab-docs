# Platform-Specific Authentication

PlayFab supports a wide variety of authentication providers. This allows your title to support different authentication methods and give your players options.

What this means is that your players can choose how they prefer to verify their identity and sign in using a method that's most natural to them.

Select authentication providers based on what is most meaningful for the players on your target platforms and distribution methods. For example, if your title is released on Xbox, it will make sense to offer Xbox Live sign-in as a way to authenticate their identity.
