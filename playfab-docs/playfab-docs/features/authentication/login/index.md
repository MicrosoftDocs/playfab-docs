# Player login

The first step in adding PlayFab to any game is to log in the player. Logging in the player returns a security token that is required for all other API calls.

PlayFab provides a breadth of login providers to enable both anonymous and recoverable login mechanisms.

## Anonymous login mechanisms  

Anonymous login mechanisms are the simplest to use. They require zero input from the player, so that there's no friction to the first time user experience - and they create a unique account in PlayFab for each player.

This is the most common login mechanism to use initially (especially for mobile games). Being anonymous, these methods can uniquely identify a device, but contain no recoverable information about this player. If the player loses or breaks their device, the account is lost, and may be very difficult to recover.

## Recoverable login mechanisms

Recoverable login mechanisms require some identity information from the player. The player must either authenticate with an external provider (e.g. Facebook, iOS, Google, Kongregate, PlayStation&#174;, Steam, Xbox Live, etc.), or manage the login directly with PlayFab, by using either a user name or email address and password.

## Best practices
  
You should begin by reading the [login best practices guide](login-basics-best-practices.md). Make sure that your game enables your players to join in and start playing quickly and easily, while providing them with a safe and secure method of getting access to their game data on multiple devices.
