# Email Messaging

With email messaging, you can send customized emails to players:

- On a prearranged schedule.
- Triggered by a PlayStream event rule.
- Or by calling an API.

The content of the emails is fully customizable, with HTML templates that can include player profile properties. The emails are sent from your own email server, so details such as the **From** and **Reply to:** fields are consistent with your brand.

Using email messaging, you can send an email to:

- Verify a userâ€™s email address.
- Reset their password.
- Target a segment of lapsed players with a link to redeem a gift.
- Notify active players of an upcoming special event.

These are just a few examples of addressing customer requests, or stimulating player engagement.
