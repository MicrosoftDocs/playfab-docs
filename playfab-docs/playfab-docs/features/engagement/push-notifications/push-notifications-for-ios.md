# Push notifications for iOS

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the concepts covered in our [Push Notifications quickstart](quickstart.md).

## Configuring the Apple notification channel

1. Ensure you have an active iO development (APNS_SANDBOX) or production (APNS) certificate. If you do not, create one from the **Apple Developer Portal** under **Certificates, Identities and Profiles**.

2. Export the certificate of your choosing (development or production):  
    - Begin by downloading a copy of your certificate from the **Apple Developer Portal** under **Certificates, Identities and Profiles**. This will create a **.cer** file.
    - Open and install the certificate into your **Keychain Access**.
    - View your installed certificate under the **Certificates** subcategory.
    - Export your **Keychain Access Certificate** to **.p12** format.

      ![Apple export Keychain Access Certificate](../media/tutorials/apple-export-keychain-cert.png)

    - Convert the **.p12 file** to a **.pem file** using the following console command:
      - `openssl pkcs12 -in apns-dev-cert.p12 -out apns-dev-cert.pem -nodes -clcerts`
    - Once you have the **.pem file**, you can upload it directly through the PlayFab **Game Manager** under your **Title's settings** > **Push Notifications**.
    - Alternatively, use the generator below to craft a JSON request for `SetupPushNotification`.

### JSON Request generator for SetupPushNotification

The request generator uses the following pieces of information to create a JSON Request:

- **Platform** - Use one of the following values: APNS (iOS), APNS_SANDBOX (iOS), GCM (Android)
- **Application Name** - Enter the name of the application sending the message.

> [!NOTE]
> Application names must only be made up of uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods, and must be between 1 and 256 characters long. They must *also* be must be *unique*.

- **PEM Certificate / API Key** -  For iOS (APNS or APNS_SANDBOX), use the complete contents of your PEM file.

Once the JSON is generated, use it to execute a call to `SetupPushNotification`. The response should look like the example that follows.

```json
{
    “code” : 200,
    “status” : “OK”,
    “data” :
        {
             “ARN” : “arn:*******/GCM/your_game_name”
        }
}
```

Congratulations! You have now configured your title’s iOS messaging channel.

## Registering your iOS Client for push

For iOS, you must rely on the default behavior of how iOS handles push notifications, as PlayFab does not offer a native implementation on Unity at this time.

By default, notifications received while the game is in the background will be routed to the **Notification** area.

Alternatively, notifications received while the game is the active app will be received silently, and will not be visible in the **Notification** area.

- The following code from the sample is run on `client Start()`.

```csharp
// must be called before trying to obtain the push token
// an asynchronous call with no callback into native iOS code that takes a moment or two before
// the token is available. (so spin and wait, or call this one early on)
// this will always return null if your app is not signed
UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationServices.RegisterForNotifications(UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationType.Alert | UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationType.Badge | UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationType.Sound, true);
```

- At this point, if the user has opted in for notifications, we can call the PlayFab API [RegisterForIOSPushNotification](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.platformspecificmethods.registerforiospushnotification).

```csharp
byte[] token = UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationServices.deviceToken;
if(token != null)
{
    RegisterForIOSPushNotificationRequest request = new RegisterForIOSPushNotificationRequest();
    request.DeviceToken = System.BitConverter.ToString(token).Replace("-", "").ToLower();
    PlayFabClientAPI.RegisterForIOSPushNotification(request, (RegisterForIOSPushNotificationResult result) =>
    {
        Debug.Log("Push Registration Successful");
    }, OnPlayFabError);
}
else
{
    Debug.Log("Push Token was null!");
}
```

- If no errors occurred, congratulations! Your iOS client has been successfully linked to your title’s Apple Notification channel.

## Troubleshooting iOS

- [Verify that you have valid .pem files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-apns.html).
- Ensure that the same certificate used in `SetupPushNotification` is used by XCode to sign your App.
- Verify that the Push Notification API is enabled for your build in XCode.
- Verify that your signing certificate matches the PlayFab platform. When running **[SetupPushNotification](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.title-widedatamanagement.setuppushnotification)**, use `OverwriteOldARN = true` to rebind the channel to a new platform. Only *one* iOS environment (APNS or APNS_SANDBOX) can be active on a title at a given time.
