# Groups, guilds and clans

The Group entity type can be utilized by your game to create guild and clan interactions within your game. This entity type gives you the ability to create different roles for members, invite members into the group, and manage group membership.

The group that you create can utilize all of the base [Entity programming model](../../data/entities/index.md) capabilities. For example, it can use [Objects](../../data/entities/entity-objects.md) and [Files](../../data/entities/entity-files.md) to store data that is specific to the Group.

To build a guild or clan system in your game, you will want to utilize the group functionality, and create a customized experience within your game.
