# Friends leaderboards

Friends-specific APIs mirror the standard [GetLeaderboard](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.getleaderboard) and [GetLeaderboardAroundPlayer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.getleaderboardaroundplayer) API calls, but restrict the player pool to the player's friends list.


> [!NOTE]
> The [GetFriendLeaderboardAroundPlayer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.getfriendleaderboardaroundplayer) API does *not* base the center of the leaderboard around the currently logged in player - it can be *any* PlayFab ID supplied with the request. You can use this to allow players to look up any friend's location on the leaderboard, regardless of their distance from each other.
