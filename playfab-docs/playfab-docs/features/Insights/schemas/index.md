# Schemas

> [!NOTE]
> The Explorer Feature is in public preview. We anticipate ongoing changes to it as we continue gathering feedback and optimizing for customer use. 

## Overview

This section describes the data and data products stored in PlayFab Insights, an in-development offering designed to provide a complete backend solution for data and analytics. For more information on the PlayFab Insights vision and strategy, see our webinar.

Out of the box, PlayFab Insights offers a database for every title. This database contains tables with all the event and processed data generated by your title. At a high level, data comes in two forms:

1. Event data streamed by the game and game services or the PlayFab APIs.

1. Processed data generated by PlayFab and its services on a scheduled basis.

Learn more about how to get started in the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) section.
