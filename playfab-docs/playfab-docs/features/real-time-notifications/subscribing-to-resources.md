# Subscribing to resources

> [!NOTE]
> Using Lobby, Matchmaking, and real-time notifications directly with REST and
> SignalR APIs is significantly more complex than using client SDKs such as the
> [Lobby C++
> SDK](../multiplayer/lobby/playfabmultiplayerreference-cpp/pflobby/pflobby_members.md)
> and [Matchmaking C++
> SDK](../multiplayer/lobby/playfabmultiplayerreference-cpp/pfmatchmaking/pfmatchmaking_members.md),
> and should only be done if the SDKs don't meet your needs.

After the client [connects to the SignalR
Hub](signalr-hub.md#connecting-to-the-signalr-hub), and calls
[StartOrRecoverSession](server-methods/start-or-recover-session.md) to receive a
`Connection Handle`, it's ready to subscribe to topics and receive messages.
When subscribing to Lobby or Matchmaking resources, the client will need to
provide the `Connection Handle` that they received when starting the session.
For more information about starting and managing a session, see the [SignalR
Hub](signalr-hub.md) overview.

To manage resource subscriptions with the services that publish notifications,
see:

| Service | Subscription API | Unsubscription API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lobby service | [SubscribeToLobbyResource](/rest/api/playfab/multiplayer/lobby/subscribe-to-lobby-resource) | [UnsubscribeFromLobbyResource](/rest/api/playfab/multiplayer/lobby/unsubscribe-from-lobby-resource) |
| Matchmaking service | [SubscribeToMatchmakingResource](/rest/api/playfab/multiplayer/matchmaking/subscribe-to-matchmaking-resource) | [UnsubscribeFromMatchmakingResource](/rest/api/playfab/multiplayer/matchmaking/unsubscribe-from-matchmaking-resource) |
