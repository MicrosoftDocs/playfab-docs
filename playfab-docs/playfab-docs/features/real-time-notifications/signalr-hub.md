# Real-time notifications SignalR Hub

> [!NOTE]
> Using Lobby, Matchmaking, and real-time notifications directly with REST and
> SignalR APIs is significantly more complex than using client SDKs such as the

> SDK](../multiplayer/lobby/playfabmultiplayerreference-cpp/pfmatchmaking/pfmatchmaking_members.md),
> and should only be done if the SDKs don't meet your needs.

The real-time notifications feature for [Lobby and Matchmaking
services](../multiplayer/lobby/lobby-and-matchmaking.md) works through a
[SignalR service](/aspnet/core/signalr), which exposes
a [SignalR Hub](/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction#hubs). This
SignalR Hub can be used by game clients to receive messages about [resources
they subscribed to](subscribing-to-resources.md).

## Connecting to the SignalR Hub

The first step in receiving real-time notifications is to create a [SignalR
client](/aspnet/core/signalr/client-features). The
client can create a connection to the SignalR Hub by [instantiating a
HubConnection](/aspnet/core/signalr/dotnet-client#connect-to-a-hub)
with the following API: [SignalR Negotiate REST
API](/rest/api/playfab/multiplayer/pub-sub/negotiate).
This API implements the Negotiate API described [in the SignalR
documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/docs/specs/TransportProtocols.md#post-endpoint-basenegotiate-request).

> [!NOTE]
> 1. SignalR client implementations expect the URL to omit the `/negotiate`
>    portion of this path (ex: HubConnection should created to a URL that ends
>    in `...playfabapi.com/pubsub`).
> 1. The auth headers required to call this API can be passed to the SignalR
>    client via `HttpConnectionOptions` as [seen on this
>    method](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.client.hubconnectionbuilderhttpextensions.withurl#microsoft-aspnetcore-signalr-client-hubconnectionbuilderhttpextensions-withurl(microsoft-aspnetcore-signalr-client-ihubconnectionbuilder-system-string-system-action((microsoft-aspnetcore-http-connections-client-httpconnectionoptions)))).
> 1. The only encoding the hub currently supports is [JSON
>    encoding](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md#json-encoding).

## Implementing client methods to receive messages

See the SignalR Client [documentation about implementing client
methods](/aspnet/core/signalr/dotnet-client#call-client-methods-from-hub)
that will be invoked to receive messages. Clients should implement all of the
methods listed in [Client methods](#client-methods) below.

## Starting and ending a session by calling server methods

See the SignalR Client [documentation about calling server
methods](/aspnet/core/signalr/dotnet-client#call-hub-methods-from-client)
to manage your session. For example, once connected to the hub, you must call
[StartOrRecoverSession](server-methods/start-or-recover-session.md) to receive a
`connection handle` that you can use to [subscribe to
resources](subscribing-to-resources.md). Similarly, once you're done with the
session, call [EndSession](server-methods/end-session.md).

## Subscribing to resources

Once a session has been started with
[StartOrRecoverSession](server-methods/start-or-recover-session.md), you can use
the `connection handle` returned to start [subscribing to
resources](subscribing-to-resources.md) and receiving messages.

## APIs

### Client methods

| Name |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| [ReceiveMessage](client-methods/receive-message.md) | Receive a notification message. |
| [ReceiveSubscriptionChangeMessage](client-methods/receive-subscription-change-message.md) | Receive a SubscriptionChangeMessage to track current subscriptions. |

### Server methods

| Name |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| [StartOrRecoverSession](server-methods/start-or-recover-session.md) | Start or recover a session. |
| [EndSession](server-methods/end-session.md) | End the session. |

#### Shared session methods

| Name |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| [AddEntityToSession](server-methods/add-entity-to-session.md) | For scenarios where multiple entities are signed in to the same device. Add an extra entity to the session, to receive messages for multiple local entities on a shared session. |
| [RemoveEntityFromSession](server-methods/remove-entity-from-session.md) | Remove an entity from the session. |
