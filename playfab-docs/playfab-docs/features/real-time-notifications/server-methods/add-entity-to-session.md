# AddEntityToSession

> [!NOTE]
> Using Lobby, Matchmaking, and real-time notifications directly with REST and
> SignalR APIs is significantly more complex than using client SDKs such as the
> [Lobby C++
> SDK](../../multiplayer/lobby/playfabmultiplayerreference-cpp/pflobby/pflobby_members.md)
> and [Matchmaking C++
> SDK](../../multiplayer/lobby/playfabmultiplayerreference-cpp/pfmatchmaking/pfmatchmaking_members.md),
> and should only be done if the SDKs don't meet your needs.

For scenarios where multiple entities are signed in to the same device. Add an
additional entity to the session, other than the entity that started the
session. This will allow the client to receive messages for multiple local
entities on a shared session.

SharedSessionResponse AddEntityToSession(SharedSessionRequest request)

> [!TIP]
> This is a SignalR server method. See [documentation on calling server
> methods](/aspnet/core/signalr/dotnet-client#call-hub-methods-from-client)
> from a SignalR client.
