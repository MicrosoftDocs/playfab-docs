# ReceiveMessage

> [!NOTE]
> Using Lobby, Matchmaking, and real-time notifications directly with REST and
> SignalR APIs is significantly more complex than using client SDKs such as the
> [Lobby C++
> SDK](../../multiplayer/lobby/playfabmultiplayerreference-cpp/pflobby/pflobby_members.md)
> and [Matchmaking C++
> SDK](../../multiplayer/lobby/playfabmultiplayerreference-cpp/pfmatchmaking/pfmatchmaking_members.md),
> and should only be done if the SDKs don't meet your needs.

Receives messages from [real-time notifications
subscriptions](../subscribing-to-resources.md).

```text
ReceiveMessage(Message message)
```

> [!TIP]
> This is a SignalR client method. See [documentation on exposing client
> methods](/aspnet/core/signalr/dotnet-client#call-client-methods-from-hub)
> in a SignalR client, which will be invoked by the server.
