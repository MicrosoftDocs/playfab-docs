# Response Status

> [!NOTE]
> Using Lobby, Matchmaking, and real-time notifications directly with REST and
> SignalR APIs is significantly more complex than using client SDKs such as the
> [Lobby C++
> SDK](../../multiplayer/lobby/playfabmultiplayerreference-cpp/pflobby/pflobby_members.md)
> and [Matchmaking C++
> SDK](../../multiplayer/lobby/playfabmultiplayerreference-cpp/pfmatchmaking/pfmatchmaking_members.md),
> and should only be done if the SDKs don't meet your needs.
