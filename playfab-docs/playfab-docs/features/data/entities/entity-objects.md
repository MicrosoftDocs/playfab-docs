# Use entity objects to store player data

Entity objects allow you to read and write small JSON-serializable objects attached to an entity. All entity types support the same `GetObjects` and `SetObjects` methods.

The examples that are shown below demonstrate setting and reading an `Object` on a `title_player_account`.

```csharp
var data = new Dictionary<string, object>()
{
    {"Health", 100},
    {"Mana", 10000}
};
var dataList = new List<SetObject>()
{
    new SetObject()
    {
        ObjectName = "PlayerData",
        DataObject = data
    },
    // A free-tier customer may store up to 3 objects on each entity
};
PlayFabDataAPI.SetObjects(new SetObjectsRequest()
{
    Entity = new EntityKey {Id = entityId, Type = entityType}, // Saved from GetEntityToken, or a specified key created from a titlePlayerId, CharacterId, etc
    Objects = dataList,
}, (setResult) => {
    Debug.Log(setResult.ProfileVersion);
}, OnPlayFabError);
```

```csharp
var getRequest = new GetObjectsRequest {Entity = new EntityKey {Id = entityId, Type = entityType}};
PlayFabDataAPI.GetObjects(getRequest,
    result => { var objs = result.Objects; },
    OnPlayFabError
);
```

## Game Manager and entities

The Game Manager allows you to manipulate objects and files for players. The player overview has been updated to show both the title player and master player account information.

In addition, files and objects now have their own sections in the **Players** tab.
