# Player encryption services

## Player shared secrets

Player shared secrets is a new type of pseudo-secret key, which is shared amongst game clients. Using an API, it can be traded for the public RSA key of the title, and can be used to perform account registration.

Titles can have multiple player shared keys, and can set them up and revoke them at will, via the Admin API calls [Create](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.createplayersharedsecret), [Update](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.updateplayersharedsecret), [Delete](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.deleteplayersharedsecret), [List](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.authentication.getplayersharedsecrets).

Player shared secrets should be baked into the respective clients, as there are no client APIs to retrieve them - either authenticated or otherwise.

## Title public key

The player shared secret is then sent to [GetTitlePublicKey](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.gettitlepublickey) which - if the key is valid - will return a Base 64 encoded RSA CSP blob byte array that can encrypt 237 bytes of data.

All APIs that allow accounts to be created, now accept posting a registration request as an encrypted payload to the `EncryptedRequest` field.

> [!NOTE]
> The standard fields **`TitleId`**, **`InfoRequestParameters`** and **`CreateAccount`** should *not* be included in the encrypted payload.

## Using title public key to register

Here is example code to register a player using `LoginWithCustomID` and the title public key.

```csharp
var titleKeyResult = PlayFabClientAPI.GetTitlePublicKey(new GetTitlePublicKeyRequest{ TitleId = "TITLE", TitleSharedSecret = "player shared secret" });

var cspBlob = Convert.FromBase64String(titleKeyResult.RSAPublicKey);

var encryptionModel = JsonConvert.SearializeObject(new LoginWithCustomIDRequest

{
    CustomID = "my player's custom id",
    PlayerSecret = "my player's individual secret"
});

string encryptedPayload;

using (var rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
{
    rsa.ImportCspBlob(cspBlob);
    var bytesToEncrypt = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(encryptionModel);
    var encryptedBytes = rsa.Encrypt(bytesToEncrypt, false);
    encryptedPayload = Convert.ToBase64String(encryptedBytes);
}

var postModel = new LoginWithCustomIDRequest
{
    TitleId = "TITLEID",
    EncryptedRequest = encryptedPayload,
    CreateAccount = True
};

var createAccountResult = PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithCustomID(postModel);
```

## Player secret

A part of the new registration system is a new field called `PlayerSecret`. If set, it allows you to sign request headers that will be validated by the server during API calls to all services, including Login Requests.

The player secret can only be set *once* per user per title (a user with multiple titles in the same studio will need to set the player secret for each one).

If the player secret isn't set during registration, it is possible to set it (if it is not already set) by calling [SetPlayerSecret](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.setplayersecret). There are admin and server APIs that allow setting the player secret to a *new* value even if it has previously been set.

> [!NOTE]
> Once set, the player secret should be stored securely on the device, as it is *not* recoverable if lost, and *no* APIs exist to recover it.

## Using player secret to sign API requests

The following code example constructs a signature header that can be used to sign API requests. The format for the signature header is shown below.

`jsonRequestModel.utcTimeStampInISO.playerSecret`

```csharp
var postModel = new LoginWithCustomIDRequest

{
    TitleId = "TITLEID",
    CustomID =  "my player's custom id",
    CreateAccount = False
};

string signatureHeader;
string timestampHeader = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("O");

string playerSecret; // the player secret that was sent during registration.

 using (var hash = new SHA256Managed())
{
    var bytesToHash = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(postModel)+"." + timestampHeader + "." + playerSecret);
    signatureHeader = hash.ComputeHash(bytesToHash);
}

var customHeaders = new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    { "X-PlayFab-Signature", signatureHeader },
    { "X-PlayFab-Timestamp", timestampHeader }
}

var loginResult = PLayFabClientAPI.LoginWithCustomID(postModel, customHeaders);
```

## Using a policy enforcement

[API Policies](https://playfab.com/blog/permission-policies/) can now be used to enforce either:

- That a client request is an encrypted payload.
- That a client request contains signed headers.

Even *without* using the policy enforcement, if an encrypted payload is sent (or the headers are sent), they will be validated and an error will occur if they are not properly formed.

To create a policy to require headers on a specific API, use a `Deny` statement. This creates a policy requiring headers on *all* calls you can place that aren't permitted by the `Allow` statement.

Policy statements have a property called `ApiConditions`. `ApiConditions` contains a property called `HasSignatureOrEncryption`, which is an enum with three possible values:

- `Any`
- `True`
- `False`

>[!NOTE]
> The default (if it is *not* set by the policy), is **`Any`**.

The following example policy will allow *all* API calls (except un-encrypted or missing header calls) to `LoginWithCustomID`.

```json
{
    "PolicyName": "ApiPolicy",
    "OverwritePolicy": true,
    "Statements":
    [
        {
            "Comment": "Require Headers on LoginWithCustomID",
            "Action": "*",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Resource": "pfrn:api--/Client/LoginWithCustomID",
            "ApiConditions": { "HasSignatureOrEncryption": "False" }
        },
        {
            "Comment": "Allow the rest policy",
            "Action": "*",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "pfrn:api--*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Because the `Deny` statement is `HasSignatureOrEncryption False`, those requests that *do not match* it will be rejected.

However, requests that *have* signature headers or encryption will be allowed by the `Allow the rest policy`.
