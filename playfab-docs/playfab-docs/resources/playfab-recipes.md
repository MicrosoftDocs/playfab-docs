# Recipes

This collection of examples shows familiar patterns and mechanics implemented using PlayFab.

## Player retention

- [Daily Prize Wheel](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFab-Samples/tree/master/Recipes/PrizeWheel) - Give players a randomized gift every day, based on the values on a "Prize Wheel".
- [Progressive Reward System](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFab-Samples/tree/master/Recipes/ProgressiveRewards) - Players that sign in consecutively over several days are granted an item, depending on how long their login streak is.

## User acquisition

- [Referral Code Bonus](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFab-Samples/tree/master/Recipes/ReferralCodes) - Generate and send codes to friends that they can redeem and unlock a bonus for both the referrer and themselves.
- [Cross-Promotional Rewards](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFab-Samples/tree/master/Recipes/SimpleCrossPromotion) - Reward players participating in more than one of your games.

## Monetization

- [Regenerating Currency Mechanic](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFab-Samples/tree/master/Recipes/RegeneratingCurrency) - A play-limiting mechanic (similar to Candy Crush lives), that slowly refills to a maximum over time.
