## Common Properties

All PlayStream events are formatted as JSON objects and share the following common properties:

|EntityId|String|The identifier for the entity (title, player, etc) to which this event applies.|
|EntityType|String|The type of entity (player, title, etc.) to which this event applies. If PlayFab is meant to take action on this entity, then the EntityType must be either 'player', 'character', or 'title'.
