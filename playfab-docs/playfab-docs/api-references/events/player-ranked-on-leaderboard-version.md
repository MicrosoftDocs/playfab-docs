# player_ranked_on_leaderboard_version

This event is triggered for the top-ranked players on a leaderboard when the leaderboard version changes (e.g. when a leaderboard statistic version is incremented). The maximum number of leaderboard entries for which the event is generated is controlled by the "Leaderboard version change top rank events sent" title limit.
