# PlayStream Event Model reference

These are the built-in PlayStream events which are automatically generated by PlayFab Game Services APIs and written to the event pipeline. In addition to these events, you can create your own custom events using the [WriteEvents](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.events.playstreamevents.writeevents) API.

Each event type has a set of properties that are included as part of event's data wherever it is sent. You can view these properties and build rules for triggering actions based on their values in the PlayStream tab of the Game Manager.
