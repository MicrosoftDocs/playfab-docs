# HTTP response status codes

This article lists global HTTP response status codes and what they mean. It also includes extra description that generally applies to all PlayFab APIs. 

Use this page as a reference guide to troubleshoot issues related to HTTP web requests. For specific descriptions that relate to a particular API, you have to go to the documentation page for that API.

If you're getting a status code that is not listed here, let us know on [PlayFab forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html) and categorize your question under __API and SDK questions__.

> [!NOTE]
> Not every API can return all of the status codes listed below. There are APIs that only return some of the codes.

| HTTP status code   | General description |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| 100                | Continue: Returned on HEAD requests |
| 200                | OK: Returned for all successful requests. May indicate partial success for bulk APIs. |
| 201                | Created: Request was successful and resource was created. |
| 202                | Accepted: Request was successful, processing will continue asynchronously. |
| 204                | No Content: API successful, but there is no response to be returned from the API.|
| 400                | Bad Request: Parameters in request where invalid or request payload structure was invalid. Do not retry.|
| 401                | Unauthorized: Caller is not authorized to either call the specific API or perform the action requested. Do not retry.|
