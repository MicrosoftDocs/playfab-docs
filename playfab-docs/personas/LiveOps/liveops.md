# Getting started with LiveOps

We believe that a successful LiveOps strategy is the single, most important contributor to a game’s ability to connect with and grow a community. That’s why PlayFab was built from the ground up -  to support great LiveOps for your game.

This document will introduce you to the LiveOps capabilities of PlayFab, and help you discover more resources for LiveOps design and implementation.

Before continuing, make sure you have completed [Getting started for developers](../../personas/developer.md) which ensures you have a PlayFab account, and are familiar with the PlayFab Game Manager.

## Exploring LiveOps

LiveOps refers to an approach to game design and development that centers around the game after launch, and specifically player engagement and retention. LiveOps processes emphasis experimentation, real-time data collection and analysis, and iteration.

If you want to learn more about LiveOps in general, and how the LiveOps approach is applied to games at every phase of development, check out [The PlayFab Definitive Guide to LiveOps](liveops-handbook.md)
