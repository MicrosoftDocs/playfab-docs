# LiveOps features

We hope you’ve found our definitive guide to LiveOps to be useful. At PlayFab, our passion is to provide the best set of tools and services to support LiveOps for all types of game developers.

This appendix details how PlayFab can support you in implementing the best practices described in this guide. We are continually investing in new features, guided in part by the LiveOps practices detailed in this guide.

Games built on PlayFab should expect a continuous stream of new features, to help make their LiveOps practices ever more effective.

- **Real-time visualization of your data pipeline**, so your LiveOps team can monitor the “heartbeat” of your game and track if anything is outside of normal trends. In-game events stream into PlayFab in real time, and can be viewed in **Game Manager**, our web-based tool. If they need to drill down, they can make a selection, and view full JSON data of any event in the pipeline.

- The ability to **troubleshoot a range of issues**, allowing you to tweak your game with confidence and your CS reps to respond effectively to service-recovery scenarios.
- **Filter and search through recent events history**, zooming in on a particular time period, player, event type, or error condition.

- High-level overview and drill-down **detailed reports of all major KPIs**, on-demand and via email, so you can keep a close eye on performance and measure the impact of changes on your live game.

- Support for real-time **player segmentation** - with PlayFab you can define segments based on player behavior and then customize your game experience for each segment, or target each segment with campaigns.

That means PlayFab is capable of supporting additional features, even if they’re not available out-of-the-box. Curious about how this can work for you? Come talk with us - we’d love to show you how - or help you brainstorm how you can use PlayFab to unlock your own innovative ideas.

- All team members can have direct access to all features of PlayFab from **Game Manager**, a single easy-to-use web portal; fees are based on how many active players you have, not employees, so everyone can collaborate.

- With powerful APIs and data-warehouse integration, PlayFab can be your teams once source of truth for data with everything in one place and a common visualization.

- Customer support reps can quickly **search across all player profiles** to locate a particular player record, review their play history, and then **make changes or grant items or currency** to help deal with a service recovery issue. They can also **ban abusive players** with temporary or permanent bans.

- **High-level overview and drill-down detailed reports of all major KPIs**, on-demand and via email, so you can keep a close eye on performance and measure the impact of changes on your live game.

  - Use **leaderboards** to rank players based on a numerical statistic, then create a social leaderboard by filtering to just friends (from Facebook, Steam, Xbox, etc.). Manually remove any players suspected of cheating.

  - **Reset leaderboards** periodically based on a fixed schedule or manually, and use **prize tables** to take automated actions for players in the leaderboard, such as automatically granting items or sending messages, depending on their rank at the time of a reset.

- For simple asynchronous multiplayer, use **data permissions** to allow one player to see certain data for another, like a card deck or city build.

- For sophisticated multiplayer games, build your own **custom game server**, then let PlayFab host it for you with **automatic scaling** in data centers around the world to ensure you never run out of room for new players. Use PlayFab’s built-in **matchmaking** algorithm to find the best match between players in real-time, based on logic you configure, or plug in your own matchmaking server.

- For simpler multiplayer games, PlayFab also offers direct support for Photon to handle message passing between clients for multiplayer without requiring a custom game server.

- Use **groups** to drive engagement through team dynamics. Make **custom player groups** and take actions based on player membership.

- **Customer support reps can quickly search across all player profiles** to locate a particular player record, review their play history, and then make changes or grant items or currency to help deal with a service recovery issue. They can also *ban abusive players* with temporary or permanent bans.

- Store your **game configuration** in PlayFab, then remotely tune and adjust your settings anytime you want, without a client update. Settings can be anything from simple key/value pairs (e.g., “XP gain rate: 1.0”) or complex JSON files.

- Configure the full **catalog of items** available for in-app granting or purchase, and update with new items at any time. Items can have limited uses, expiration times, custom JSON data, tags and more.

- **Host all your game assets** in PlayFab. Upload manually via the Game Manager, or automatically via command line tools or the admin API directly from your build pipeline.

- Stream assets down to your game clients via a **global CDN**. Use our default CDN (with pass-through billing) or configure your own custom CDN to point to PlayFab to retrieve files.

- **For sophisticated multiplayer games, build your own custom game server**, then let PlayFab host it for you with **automatic scaling** in data centers around the world to ensure you never run out of room for new players. Use PlayFab’s built-in *matchmaking* algorithm to find the best match between players in real-time, based on logic you configure, or plug in your own matchmaking server.

- **Monetization** is one of the most important elements of your game’s strategy. Here too PlayFab has powerful tools and services to maximize your upside while protecting you from the many pitfalls.

- Don’t let fraudsters ruin your game - and empty your pockets - with fake purchases. Server-side **receipt validation** ensures your Apple or Google receipts are genuine before a player completes a purchase transaction. PlayFab also supports **third-party payment processing** from Xsolla, PayPal, Steam, Xbox, and more.

- Stimulate demand with **rare or limited-edition items** that have enforced scarcity, or craft attractive **bundles** for first-time or regular players.
  
- Optimize conversion and revenues by creating **targeted stores** aimed at specific segments. These stores can offer a subset of items, have special offers and discounts, and custom data fields.
- Handle a global audience with support for multiple **real-world currencies**, and avoid the pay-to-win trap with support for **multiple virtual currencies**.
- Foster cooperative behavior by supporting **gifting and trading between players**, or celebrate holidays by gifting from system to player.
- Open up new recurring revenue channels by offering **subscriptions** for ongoing services. For example, charge $9.99 every month for your VIP program.
- While many game developers like to have a hands-on negotiating strategy for ad mediation, they’re often forced to work with the mediation firm’s analytics. PlayFab integrates with popular ad mediation providers for **rewarded video ad tracking**. PlayFab’s also there when you need to **track reward offers** so you can fulfill them accurately.
- Running **live events**: As we’ve shown in this guide, live events are powerful drivers for player engagement and monetization. PlayFab provides all the building blocks you’ll need to build a full live events system, including:

  - Multiple ways to define and configure your **list of all upcoming events**. We have a demo showing how to use an item catalog and store to do this.

  - For competitive events, create one-off **event leaderboards** to motivate players and update them with **automation rules**. Use **prize tables** to automatically give out prizes when the event ends.

  - Replace your standard stores for the duration of the event with **custom event stores** that feature special discounts, bundles, and offers just for that event.

  - Remind players about upcoming events using a **message-of-the-day**, and fire off a **push notification** or **e-mail** to notify players when the event starts.

- Boosting **player retention and engagement** is one of the main reasons to invest in LiveOps. A back end platform like PlayFab provides a variety of features to help, including:

  - Review your 1, 7, and 30-day new player retention with the **daily retention report**.

  - Help game designers tune and tweak the game to make it more fun by digging deeply into player behavior using PlayFab Insights. Analyze where players are dropping out and test theories for why.

  - Build game mechanics like “daily rewards” using a combination of PlayFab’s CloudScript (server-hosted game logic) and player data stored on the server - where it can’t be tampered with by players intent on cheating.

  - Use the **rules engine** and **custom player data events** to build a powerful achievements system that reacts in real-time when players meet the criteria for a new event, and can be updated with new achievements at any time.

  - Player lost their phone? Avoid sending them back to square one by **storing their game progress** in the cloud on PlayFab. **Link accounts** together to provide multiple ways of recovering an account, such as using their Steam, Facebook, or Google accounts.

  - Take the right action for the right player at the right time through **real-time player segmentation**. Divide players into groups based on a variety of properties including spend, geography, device, client version, play patterns, and acquisition channel. Then, experiment with triggering actions as players enter or exit segments. You can also use PlayFab to **run scheduled tasks** that apply to all players in a given player segment, which lets you combine the efficiency of automation with the intimacy of a message or offer crafted to appeal to a particular audience.

  - **Communicate** to individual players, or to all players in a segment, via the channel that fits your needs best - including push notifications to iOS and Android, email messages to player email accounts and message-of-the-day pop-ups. You can also send messages in response to rule triggers you create (e.g., “we’re sorry you keep dying…”) and customize messages using parameters.

- Once your game hits the **plateau phase**, it can still be very profitable. PlayFab’s **per-active-player pricing** means that your operating costs scale with usage. As your players drop, your costs drop, allowing you to maintain healthy margins all the way down.
