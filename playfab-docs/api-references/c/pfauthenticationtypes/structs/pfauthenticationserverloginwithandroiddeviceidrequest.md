We will be updating to show all linked devices in a future release."

# PFAuthenticationServerLoginWithAndroidDeviceIDRequest  

PFAuthenticationServerLoginWithAndroidDeviceIDRequest data model. On Android devices, the recommendation is to use the Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID as the AndroidDeviceId, as described in this blog post (http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/03/identifying-app-installations.html). More information on this identifier can be found in the Android documentation (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html). If this is the first time a user has signed in with the Android device and CreateAccount is set to true, a new PlayFab account will be created and linked to the Android device ID. In this case, no email or username will be associated with the PlayFab account. Otherwise, if no PlayFab account is linked to the Android device, an error indicating this will be returned, so that the title can guide the user through creation of a PlayFab account. Please note that while multiple devices of this type can be linked to a single user account, only the one most recently used to login (or most recently linked) will be reflected in the user's account information. We will be updating to show all linked devices in a future release.
