# Scheduled tasks

Scheduled tasks are a way to automate common game operation routines. Some examples are:

- Updating [Title Data](../../../features/titledata/index.md)to reflect changes for a current event.
- Injecting virtual currencies into the game economy daily.
- Modifying prices in a store according to the time of day.
- Reaching out to lapsed players and encouraging them to re-engage.

Automated tasks can take predefined actions or execute [CloudScript](../../../features/automation/cloudscript/index.md), which enables any custom server-side functionality you want to implement.
